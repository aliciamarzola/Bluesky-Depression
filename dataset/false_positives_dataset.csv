I’m so tired of the news,1
"Found out a lil while ago that my aunt is dying. I'm devestated

Normally my grief process is idk? Colder? I usually become numb, in shock, but slowly come back to normal. Kinda gives me time to process you know?

I think I'm just so emotionally and mentally exhausted that my defenses are down...",1
"I know it’s unlikely but I hope DEEPLY that I can get a job as soon as possible and move as far away from Mississippi as possible. I’ve lived so much of my life here, afraid to be myself outwardly because of hate and I just don’t know how much longer I can last before I hit my limit",1
"I legitimately feel like the Andy Parks and Rec ""Life is pointless and nothing matters"" monologue lately and I can't get out of the funk. Just everything sucks",1
i just realized i can't remember what her voice sounds like and now i feel so numb,1
"Totally agree, any whiff of any kind of drama type antics and I disappear from the scene and write off such people from my life, so not worth it and drama only attracts more drama, so pointless. And is boring ",1
women are scary but my suicidal thoughts are scarier,1
"I want to socialize, to chat, to have and be friends. I can’t connect that desire with the necessary will to exert what I feel is pointless effort.

I want to hike and camp, but can’t pull myself away from the thoughtless repetition of a non-life.

It’s hard to find meaning when you don’t look.",1
It’s weird to feel this good after struggling with suicidal thoughts the whole week but I take it. It’s a good reminder that things can be different.,1
"Then his brain starts to really torture him.

/what if he doesn’t like me back?/
/what if i ruin everything?/
/what if he never talks to me again?/

He tosses and turns, until he finally passes out sometime around 3am.",1
"that was my mom's father. she lost her sister a few months later. and my dad lost his dad last November. after all that, along with my newest friend group randomly started ghosting me, and I was behind in school, I was in a really bad mental place, and I was beginning to have suicidal thoughts.",1
i feel like i wanna die,1
"Love being suddenly assaulted with ""no one I like really cares much about me or would notice if I disappeared"" in my head",1
Depression is such a bitch,1
"Probably thanks to poor sleep and dream residue clonking around my subconscious, partly due an uncomfortable realization about how I’ve handled some of my life, today’s bounced between weapons grade irritability, passive suicidal thoughts, and just wishing I had resources for talk therapy.",1
the moment i found out that passive suicidal thoughts are not normal and not everyone has them i became so acutely aware of them that it pisses me off,1
"I finally figured out I don't want to die - and the country I can't escape wants me dead.

What am I supposed to do with that?",1
"Depression & loneliness can feel like carrying an invisible weight, one that makes even the simplest parts of life feel like a storm. But if you’re sitting in that darkness right now, please know you’re not alone. Someone out there understands. Someone cares. it’s okay to take it breath by breath",1
I can't wait for winter to end I'm so tired of this cold weather and being sick,1
If I disappeared.... Probably no one would even notice....,1
