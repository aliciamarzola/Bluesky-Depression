"when all you have is property to fill the sad, hateful emptyness in your life, i guess it makes sense",1
i just‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm tired of trying to see the bright side. i don‚Äôt even need good things to happen i just need the bad stuff to take some time off. i don‚Äôt know how much more i can deal with and i‚Äôm tired of fighting to keep my head above water when everything seems to be trying to hold me under.,1
i'm always shocked at anyone who wants to disappear entire segments of humanity. which in itself is shocking given how many of them want exactly that. i live with a lesbian immigrant from a caribbean island nation who has a disabled child who thinks trans people should not exist.,1
sad,1
"gah i've been trying to resist responding to that post even where he couldn't see it but i can't take it anymore. gamers do the opposite of fighting impossible odds in games, the odds in games are very carefully designed to be within the ability of players without being too easy or too frustrating.",1
"thank you so much for talking about this because i‚Äôm literally in my dysphoria blues today and it‚Äôs exactly this. adults forgetting that i‚Äôm still a child, strangers commenting on my body, the feeling like i want to disappear so i‚Äôm not perceived but at the same time knowing no one really sees me ",1

"it was january 2020, we weren't in the throes of the pandemic yet. i was extremely burned out doing volunteer work. you know the kind of overwhelming burnout that makes you want to fake your death and disappear into the wilderness? that. specifically the yukon. i love the cold and the dark.",1
and what happens when i can‚Äôt take it anymore?,1
i'm so fucking tired of everything today,1
having poor interoception is difficult. i'm like... am i sick? am i anxious? why do i feel so bad? tired? dehydrated? need to go to the bathroom? running through the list of everything i've done and eaten today. sitting for a while to try and tune into my body and interpret the mixed signals. lol ,1
"yes. dumber than this in fact.
the pastor makes ‚Äòem as dumb and ‚Äúskeerd‚Äù as you need them.

that level of emptyness",1
"i just hate broken stuff, it frustrated me to a point where i'm teaching myself to fix everything",1
"i'm sorry that i'm just an artist. sorry that at 33 years old, i have no skills to help stop a pandemic. no money to pay for people to flee. no influence or pull to rally people together (as i have been trying to do). it feels terrible to be so useless. i feel like i deserve to be shamed.",1
"and then if we see either more early gop resignations who can't take it anymore or deaths during office (not that we don't want to celebrate those), dems could have the potential through special elections to flip the house during a session of congress.

"finished my run and feeling great. sending you all love and hugs!
",1
"the media loves to create controversy for the sake of it, they love a gotcha and tittle tattle. they need to remember their job is to inform without fear or favour and to report the facts. i've given up on all msm now, my blood pressure can't take it anymore.",1
same! it feels so much nicer i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm rotting as much. i can use twitter a lot less by just posting there when i want to and checking notifications but for the most part i really don‚Äôt have to use that hell hole much for just scrolling that can be done here it feels better.,1
i'm so fuckinf. tired vro and my mum is mocking me for it i can't take it anymore ,1

good morning,1
"i looked it up and it's 70 and sunny in butler today, the perfect combination for starting off feeling great then getting sweatier and sweatier as the day goes on, that audience has got to be listless and uncomfortable coming into hour three of standing there.",1
"i always crash after such an exciting night, like what am i supposed to now? 

i feel empty, i don‚Äôt want to wait another week",1
"""i want the separation between the expression of politics in the gallery and the practice of politics in life to disappear.""

"i agree. you may disagree but she is the women's division darby allin. she can lose, disappear and when she come backs the crowd is still 100% behind and with her. i want her to be the holder of both women's and tbs belts.",1
"my husband has been on annual leave this week and we've had a nice relaxing break, playing lots of board games, even though i've not been feeling well with my fibromyalgia. but now he's back to work tomorrow and i'm really not looking forward to just feeling rubbish and useless all day.",1

i love working with my hands, creating something i can hold, combing through old notebooks. i'm going to focus on that more.",1
"i don‚Äôt want to be here.  i want to delete this from my phone.  an app that keeps me in fear.  fear of what awful danger he might unleash.  if i don‚Äôt have this it may be missed.  
isn‚Äôt that what being a hostage is?  today has been the worst so far since the election.  i‚Äôm just sad.",1
"yeah, i have been overdoing it. my knees, ankles, and hips are all kind of not feeling great.

i think i'd best just walk today. maybe even stroll. 

all that high impact has been a bit much. i've tried to stay low to the ground... sigh.",1
"i literally can't take this anymore tbh, fedi constantly banishing on bluesky is just kinda dissappointing, especially for me, a fedi user.

also, 2 fediverse projects (mastodon and misskey) are sponsored by crypto-based mask network, not that big of a deal. same goes for bc's sponsorship with bsky.",1
"it‚Äôs amazing how i can wake up feeling great, and ill to my stomach by the time i‚Äôve finished scanning the news. ",1
