i just don't care.",1
so hard. omg. every day that goes by....i can't take it anymore,1
feeling the same today rave bean  i just want to disappear  sending you any positive vibes i can muster,1
"everything feels so pointless and empty. i don't need a purpose to live, i don't need a reason, but i do need company. i feel like i'm just fading, rotting, vanishing from the world. i feel so fucking isolated. at least before i knew you i didn't know what it was like to be seen for who i was.",1
"i’m so tired of being the ‘crazy’ one that is wearing a mask, testing all sniffles, using filters, not eating in, opting out of crowded indoor events… i get all the way from pity, to smirks, to outright anger, because i’m not fucking giving into this mass delusion of everything being back to normal.",1
"i know that major depressive disorder is common enough that society doesn't typically think about it as a disability, but this round sure has been disabling for me. i feel like i can't do anything anymore and when i can it takes me burning five times the energy that it used to",1
"you ever just say, or think, to yourself ""i just need..."" and then wait for your mind, body, or fuggin someone to tell you what this emptyness is?

just me?",1
"so as i sit here with all that history, no future, and an empty belly, hatred by god, cast out from larger society. i can just feel the wight crushing me bit by bit.",1
everything is so bad right now. i really wish i didn't have to be here. i don't want to live through this. i never asked to be here.,1
i feel empty,1
"i feel empty, lonely, unwanted, and abandoned. no one really wants to talk to me anymore. i always get the vibe that people are just humoring me, but really they think i'm annoying and try to get rid of me as fast as they can.""",1
"depressed people depress people? 
gee, thanks. now i'm even more depressed.",1
it feels so bad. i feel like i should be making something everyday or else im useless but at the same time my brain is like :) no u will do nothing :),1
"found out something today that is just the cherry on my depression sundae lately. been feeling particularly useless and listless lately and this is not helping. i will deal of course, i always do.",1
i’m tired of feeling like i have to brave everything out alone every time i get the courage to let my guard down and start depending on people. really starting to think i’d be happier if i moved far away from everyone and everything i know and just allow myself to truly be alone.,1
"going on a rant.....
i'm tired, just like the majority of americans, with pretty much everything. these are my opinions and i've had many people agree with me. now i need someone with leverage to help us all!
all americans should be afforded these basic needs 
1/",1
"i feel blue, and no one else understands why, because i don't understand too.

sometimes i just want to disappear.",1
"i can't take it anymore, i am sick of being the only one doing things around the house, if it's one thing it's another, so for once my mom needs to start using the prosthetic leg, because i cannot do this anymore, all the stress being put on me when doing things around the house is tiring, i'm done.",1
sorry world being sick & tired & cramped & overwhelmed & unmotivated & art blocked got me feeling like this,1
"because they like me i think
im so afraid people dont actually like me and the urge to just disappear and block everyone sounds tempting sometimes but i know i cant not only because i dont want to hurt anybody, but because i know i would come crawling back to them anyways",1
"as much as outro: tear makes me wanna cry, there are some days it's the perfect catharsis for the feels in my head with how hard it hits.",1
maybe eating more food will fill the emptyness of my lonely soul.,1
"when all you have is property to fill the sad, hateful emptyness in your life, i guess it makes sense",1
i just… i’m tired of trying to see the bright side. i don’t even need good things to happen i just need the bad stuff to take some time off. i don’t know how much more i can deal with and i’m tired of fighting to keep my head above water when everything seems to be trying to hold me under.,1
"thank you so much for talking about this because i’m literally in my dysphoria blues today and it’s exactly this. adults forgetting that i’m still a child, strangers commenting on my body, the feeling like i want to disappear so i’m not perceived but at the same time knowing no one really sees me ",1
i want to be a beer foam and disappear,1
"it was january 2020, we weren't in the throes of the pandemic yet. i was extremely burned out doing volunteer work. you know the kind of overwhelming burnout that makes you want to fake your death and disappear into the wilderness? that. specifically the yukon. i love the cold and the dark.",1
and what happens when i can’t take it anymore?,1
i'm so fucking tired of everything today,1
i'm so fuckinf. tired vro and my mum is mocking me for it i can't take it anymore,1
"i always crash after such an exciting night, like what am i supposed to now?

"still nowhere near low enough.  when it gets to 10 cents, i’ll express a sigh of relief and say, “still nowhere near low enough.” 
i want tesla to go completely defunct and disappear into oblivion.",1
keith richards helps me remember that nothing matters.,1
"i don’t want to be here.  i want to delete this from my phone.  an app that keeps me in fear.  fear of what awful danger he might unleash.  if i don’t have this it may be missed.  
isn’t that what being a hostage is?  today has been the worst so far since the election.  i’m just sad.",1
