I am very tired. Everything is relentless. I regret nothing about choosing to spend Christmas by myself with my cat and a pile of M&S food. I just need to decide what I’m watching.,0
"And then today my car breaks down. Oh, and my uterus has now finally completely turned against me despite me having ZERO children at 42. She'll probably end up getting snatched out.

I just need a break and somebody to really love me. I can take care of everything else. I'm so tired.

"I’ve been working so FUCKING hard for the past 10 years, and I had everything set up for 2025 to be the year I finally got my feet underneath of me…

"F*ck this recovering from a three week Covid infection on top of existing Long Covid. I'm so tired and weak I'm almost in tears. Everything hurts, my brain is mush. I'm terrified with each invetiable re-infection comes more loss of quality of life.",0
"I’m so tired of explaining my job is not just sex. It’s hardly 10% of it. That’s “the easy” part, if you consider fucking strictly for how it shows up on camera to be easy. People are so quick to assume they know everything that goes into being a creator despite no paying job being that simple.",0
"This YouTube video basically explains why I really like this app/site, and why I'm simultaneously tired of every social media/SNS app/site, including YouTube itself.

Everything has been reconfigured to just waste your time, and show you stuff you dont want but are similar enough what you like.",0
"I’m just happy that the election is finally over. Just gonna sit lay down and sleep. Hopefully now the internet or least socials won’t be so polarized anymore, there can be peace. Just tired of the drama and violence. Hope everything will be okay.",0

I feel like it’s Astoria-on 3/14/2020. That weird hush over everything while we recklessly drank and danced. Everything shuttered the next day. Then mos of people dying. It feels like that. Only this is at least 4yrs. Knowing that makes me so tired and distracted. I’m here-but not really.,0
"You know God, I have some complaints to submit! You’ve really been off your game for a while now. Get it together bro cause I’m tired of this 💩. A few perfectly aimed lightening bolts would not be unappreciated. Does Gaia have to do everything?",0

I'm just always tired. Regardless of everything,0
"I'm sick & tired of people who understandably keep their heads in the sand because everything is too much...but then when confronted w/ facts re: this genocide, or the pandemic, or the presidential situation in the U.S., they feel attacked & like they know better than me, who does pay attention.",0
"Don't make me come down there are start explaining to you all how the three branches of government work, because I'm fucking tired.

Kamala Harris was not president. The president can't do everything by executive action. The VP is a shitty job with no real job. The end.
