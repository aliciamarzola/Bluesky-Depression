"TW: Suicidal Mention

Honestly gonna take a break for a few days again. Today was actually so bad for me I started having suicidal thoughts so thats time for me to clock out",0
"Went through it with last 5yrs w/our now 18 yr old, thought it was mental health issues causing gender dysphoria. Tried therapy, multiple meds, etc.,still anxious,
depressed, self-harming & having suicidal thoughts/ideology. Seems like we had it backwards the whole time…",0
"Driving out to the mountains and got an alert that there're  ""bear issues"" at my campsite. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but I've never had ""I want to be eaten alive by a bear"" thoughts.",0
"TW Suicide:

As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my life, I get it. Today is rough as hell for everyone's mental health. I won't lie, I've had those thoughts in the past 24hrs but I'm not useful in the fight to get our rights back if I'm dead

Take care of yourself please.",0
"Sometimes, while looking at this black and white picture of me, I wonder if this was the last time I could be so happy and carefree. The picture itself has gone through hardships, as I did, contrary to Dorian Gray’s portrait. #selfie",0
I just want everything to stop for long enough to get my feet back under me. I feel like I've been scrambling nonstop the past 24 months and getting nowhere. I need a chance to catch up without everything else careening further away.,0
