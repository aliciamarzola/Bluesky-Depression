"TW: Suicide



The depression is bad tonight. I'm getting suicidal thoughts - the feeing that I can't do anything right, I'm wrong about everything, I can't even look after Marmite properly. It's all shit.",1
I'm tired of being a burden... I want to be better... But I don't know how...,1
"i have literally had a depression diagnosis since july 2015, and not once has a medical professional thought how i interact with depressing/suicidal thoughts as weird or unusual. like that part kindof flabergasts me... i have used depressive spirals/episodes as a descriptor since 2019... the fuck?",1
"I'm basically non-functional without adderall (not to mention how it helps my anxiety) and my depression is... manageable with an SSRI. 

I've struggled hard with suicidal thoughts and self-harming and for the first time I'm not okay but I'm better than I was. 

Fuck this fucking ghoul.",1

I’m so fucking tired of goyim weaponizing antisemitism claims.,1

"I just hate my life. 
I hope something will end my life any day.",1
"I’m sorry to hear that as well. It’s a very strange feeling for sure. I thought about her a fair bit, but basically it was as if she was already gone… but now that she really is gone… it’s just really sad.",1
