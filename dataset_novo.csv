I’ve been following you for a good while & you got duped like the rest of us. You claimed that Trump would go to prison & he wouldn’t be able to run for president. Yet here we are. I don’t want to hear “we can’t do something” if the founders didn’t do something then where would we be?,0
"Look, I have two particular types: Smooth elf twink or big furry werewolf, & when you said that you don't fit either type I told you it wouldn't be a problem if you came back with me.

So now that you're here which way you want the slider to go? Be thankful you get the choice.",0
Here too. I’ve reduced by 8%. Don’t want to go any further or I’ll never be able to buy what I need now.,0
"The problem is that we've had four years of Trump. A more apt analogy would be like the guy currently punching us in the face saying ""You don't want me to bring the guy with the sledgehammer and hobbling post back in here, do you?"" And, like... that's correct. I don't want that. But it still sucks.",0
"i grew up on fb and insta as an early adopter and i thought it would be so hard. but it turns out i hate the oligarchy so much that it feels easy and like a relief to remove myself from something i don’t want to support.

"Idk, I don't want politicians to ruin the peace we have here. I fear it would lead to people like Zuck and Musk joining and that would ruin everything.

If politicians actually _wanted_ to engage with their constituents, then yes, social media sites would be the best place to do it.",0
"This would be a good opportunity to showcase the brothers in the Sharon story. I know Adam has been largely removed from it and I don’t want to see a huge bromance thing going, but they could be a good team to find her at least. Nick can’t go it alone here. #yr",0
"For all the artists soliciting commissions here, I don't want you to reach out to me. I'll reach out to you if I want to commission you. 
Although a tag for artists would be nice actually so I can see it clearer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0
"Yo skyline !
I know in today’s times WE ALL got some shit going on.. for a lot of us life don’t even feel real at points

Or even really for the UK to rejoin.",0
"I don’t understand people that come onto, what is essentially, the last bastion of civility in social media and just want to be angry for no reason. 

Like ok - a politician posts something dumb on here - go for it. Leave a comment. 

But to random normal people?? It’s just odd behavior.",0
"Wow, a Lot of people want this or like this, its doing severals here. Gonna be real, I don’t know how to go about this, I need suggestions. Please comment.",0
"Some good ideas from @blairmcdougall.com here. Bur we need more radical steps to reform our democracy. All  corporate donations for political parties in UK should be stopped, not just foreign ones. And a cap on individual donations. I don't want billionaires destroying democracy, foreign or British.",0

I miss nights like this with my little fur baby 17 years just wasn’t enough time. It’s been 3 months & life isn’t the same & feel so empty and sad everything reminds me of her. She used to love watching TV getting her little belly rubs & pets with me before bed.,0

I miss what I thought I had
I don't wanna feel it

Who I thought I knew
But reality is pretty too
Even with a gap toothed smile
I'll grin
Empty hand, indented",0
