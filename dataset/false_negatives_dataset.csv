Without some form of agony.

I left twitter because I’m sick of having these conversations. I’ve been having stupid conversations like this with sudo intellectuals for nearly a decade and I’m tired. You know what bigotry is. I’m not gonna play games like this anymore. This is the kinda shit making me and my friends suicidal.,0

"Had a bad depressive episode last night. Stared at the wall. Felt like I couldn't speak. My heart was racing. I barely slept.

This morning, perhaps predictably, my partner thinks I'm mad at them and it's all their fault. 

Love that for me.",0
"I try hard to be, and do, good. I fail at it a lot. I fail everyday, probably. I don't think that it's obtainable in like a tangible sense. 
""You're good now, job's done!"" isn't really a thing that happens. But I'm gonna keep trying, and I hope someday I can leave a lasting positive impact on others",0
"it's supposed to be a great new beginning, a new year..so why am i sitting here filled with dread & tears falling uncontrolled? i want to fast forward to the better times ahead...or fall back to better times i've enjoyed. i don't want to face forward to the next 4 years. so glad i'm not alone...",0
"For what it's worth I never wonder about such things. I've made so many mistakes and done so many terrible things if I allowed myself to dream it would consume me.

If I met another me I'd might have to kill him on sight, very likely they'd be an even worse version of me.",0

"Corny things are the way I distract myself from suicidal thoughts, but I've been doing it for too long, which makes my brain associate them together. Now my corny feelings and suicidal thoughts come together, and that's so annoying because if I let the corny feelings out all it left is the bad stuff",0
"Just thought posting don't be worried pls. Legit honestly a good thing I don't own a gun given how my thoughts swings, lucky enough I don't have the nerve to SH but then it makes feel like I'm not good enough to be suicidal idk. Also reading people saying they want to kms just annoys me idk anymore",0
"Well, there goes my plans for the next 4 years.

Without outing myself, the new administration is going to be a direct threat to my employment.

For those who don't know, me not being employed has led to suicidal thoughts in the past.

I am fine for now, but I'm going to be canceling a lot of plans.",0
