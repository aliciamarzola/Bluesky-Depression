"Wow, that's so great admin gave you one. Surprisingly easy to use too. I admit to feeling a bit pretentious wearing it when strangers filling up a large room at a conference. But they all look so surprised and happy to be able to hear me, even in the back, it is worth it, lol",0
"Highly recommend the short story Instar by @karenheuler.bsky.social in @reactorsff.bsky.social! Hard to express why it's so great without getting spoilery but you may start the story feeling disoriented, then move thru a range of emotions as you begin to understand...

"I stopped at a market on the way back, and for the first time in 4+ years, I was the only one, in a pretty big grocer, in a respirator. So depressing. I’ve always been OK going my own way — often, as with this, I’ve had no choice. But feeling so separate isn’t great",0

"I’m cruising through this one piece which I don’t think I’ve actually even rehearsed with the ensemble, I’m singing it against a recorded track and really nailing it, feeling SUPER proud of myself and thinking what a great sightreader I am, when I come in proud and strong on an exposed entrance",0

"Feeling all emotional and the coffee shop I'm working at hits me with ""Such great heights"". Not cool coffee shop, not cool.",0
"I understand how you’re feeling too! It’s like you become overly aware that a camera is on you. It can also be difficult to do when balancing the stream and chat because who knows what will come up.

I think you’re doing a great job on streams and think it’s very good of you to have this reflection.",0
"Such a great feeling, congrats on finding a trustworthy literary surgeon 👏",0
I live in a constant loop of my mental feeling great but my body feeling shit or my body feeling great and my mental feeling shit. Its so tiring can you fuckers align please,0

Hey Tara,
Hope you’re feeling great again. 
Thanks for being here and following my feed.

"Same, I would’ve loved to see him left his gloves in the octagon last night and called it a career, you couldn’t ask for a better ending, a great back and forth action fight that you ended with a spectacular walk off KO. But I have a feeling bc he looked so good last night, he’s gonna fight again:(👎🏾",0
"Random picture. Was feeling cute. Might delete later or not LOL.

I hadn't been in the mood for S5 (dunno why, the others were good-to-great, just not feeling it I guess) but NOW I need to see it",0
It’s not a great feeling. Lifeguard was opening for a band doing a 20-year album anniversary tour and said “we weren’t born when this album came out”. I thought it was quite rude,0
I too was supposed to finish my middle grade novel this month. It feels very unlikely I’ll get this last 12k written in the next 2 days. It’s not a great feeling. I’m right there with you.,0

"“Our Heritage: 

Our search for a home took us through the cosmos. For many a great cycle we roamed, yet a place to call our home eluded us. In time, we began to despair, feeling the search was in vain. We considered remaining among the stars until…(contd.)",0

"Finally diving in. I'm still a little scared as a fan of Smiley since my teens in the 80s, but between the great review and my love for Harkaway's novels I have a fairly good feeling about this one. #booksky",0
