i’m just sick & tired of everything.,1
i just can’t take it anymore.,1
loving halloween and having depression feels so cursed  what do you mean it’s my favorite day/holiday but i feel empty inside ,1
that's so sad.,1
i’m really tired of going through things and being strong and whatever else i tell myself so i don’t have a mental breakdown about everything. i need next year to be better because i can’t take it. i feel it in my body now and it’s exhausting.,1
great feeling,1
why cant i feel anything other than emptyness,1
"hi besties

sorry i haven’t been active much lately. i’ve been sick and feeling really not great for the last week. hopefully i’ll start feeling better this week ",1
"i'll try, but i don't want to be here anymore. i've been beat down and mistreated my entire life and now its only going to get worse across the board. i can't afford to go anywhere else, so i'm trapped in a sinking ship with no way off. i'll try, but i so desperately want to end it.",1
god i just want to be swallowed up by the earth and disappear,1
"goodnight, friends. having an early one tonight because i am not feeling great.",1
that’s it. i give up. nothing matters anymore.,1
"but yeah

i feel like there isn't much of a point
and i'm tired of this stupid game that's going on",1
i hate myself i want to disappear,1
"i’ve had company this entire week and i haven’t been able to read my book in the mornings, i feel empty  ",1
"at this point, i don't want anything anymore.

usually people associate suicidality with emotion and affect. but i feel incredibly calm. and i don't want to die out of rage at the world or self-loathing.

i just need to disappear. because i want absolutely nothing more from this physical reality.",1
i don’t want to rest. i want to disappear,1
i’m so tired of crying i’m so tired of waking up w headaches i just wanna not have to work so hard for literally everything ,1
"so a cool* thing about depression is how it can make me completely incapable of anticipating or feeling any sense of reward from any activity!

it makes for a great** combination with post-viral fatigue syndrome making almost any activity feel tiring.

*terrible
**terrible",1
i honestly don't know how i feel about this.,1
"kinda wish i could just find someone i could be happy with. only kinda. not desperate at all.  nope. certainly don't feel empty rn. absolutely no melancholy here. nuh-uh. not an ounce of jealousy or sadness. tired of just floating through life, all while trying to enjoy it? can't be me!",1
i wish i could just hibernate. i'm tired of everything that life keeps throwing at me.,1
"i don’t feel like i deserve anything i have to be honest. i don’t just mean things like relationships, i mean anything. i don’t feel like i deserve the computer i have, the people that love me, or even the food i eat everyday. i feel worthless, more so recently than usual but i don’t know why.",1
i am feeling very useless as a human being rn,1
"after something big happens in my life i feel so empty 

i was looking forward to that show for five months and now that it’s over i feel… empty again.",1
"i give up on everything. i tried to get up and do things today but i literally fell to the ground and just laid there crying for 10 minutes. i need a break. i’m tired of pushing, i’m tired of climbing uphill everyday just to survive. i need a break",1
"i want to disappear 

i don't know what i should do, could it be me who is the problem?",1
"so being frequently low-key depressed is less crappy than having more severe depression, but tbh, i didn't used to get depressed this often and bah...
it's probably pretty much that half the country's legislators want me and mine to disappear, & a bunch of folks who voted for them are down with that",1
"i’m just so done. i can’t keep having nights like this. i don’t know what i’m doing and some nights i just want to burn every little vestige of me and disappear. it’s truly unbearable some nights and i just, i need something to change but somehow this is the biggest constant of my life",1
"everytime anxiety gets so loud, and i don't want to go for self destructive coping mechanisms, the urge to delete everything and disappear gets bigger (it's also a bad coping mechanism)",1
"i was a bit wtf? because it was as if nearly everything had died, and i was walking through emptyness. but i wasnt .....but it was quite peculiar .",1
"at what point do i just give up on everything?
i’m tired of all of it.",1
i'm just always tired. regardless of everything,1
i’m so tired of feeling like i’m supposed to have an opinion on everything. i have decided to no longer have any opinions on anything. gonna give my brain a rest,1
"i just want a bit of a giggle, chat and light stuff. 
if it keeps going this way i will disappear. i can’t do much and i don’t want to read gravy stuff to lower my mood even more",1
not feeling great about things,1
"i feel like i'm in shock.

just... shaky, nauseated a little, stunned.

i can't process what happened.

i don't know what's next.

i feel emptyness.",1
three of every four posts on here.  every discord i'm in.  every group chat i'm in.  everything.  it's constant and i'm so tired.,1
"i'm so fucking tired of being so exhausted all the fucking time, i feel like its putting some of my most important connections at risk and i can't to shit but watch everything crumble",1
everything in life lately has felt either sad or terrifying or both at the same time & i just want to disappear into a forest and live off grid. i am tired,1
i feel so empty.,1
"for me, depression isn't feeling constantly sad, it's constantly feeling a lack of emotion. it feels like there's a hole in my chest that i can't fill. just this empty void of emotionless... nothing. 

i desperately just want to feel something. anything. something beyond passive things.",1
"i’m sad, scared, angry, and so fucking tired.

i also feel like i should have something to say about *gestures at everything* but i really don’t.

i literally just want to share silly stuff and pictures of my critters. not deal with the bullshit.",1
 i spend a lot of time feeling useless!,1
"there’s a particular kind of tired when i’m completely tapped out emotionally.

it happened after my mom died. after the hospital and the funeral. when everything was quiet and still.

i’m feeling that now. and it is temporary.",1
feeling useless about stuff that's out of my control. just wish i could do more to help,1
why am i posting here? no one will see this. no one will care. no one does care. i want to disappear forever and be gone.,1
"i'm tired of everything being so difficult. i just wanted an easy, relaxing day. oof",1
"feeling absolutely over the hill right now. not just struggling with myself, but entirely undesirable, unloveable, unwanted... self esteem is through the floor. 
can't even begin to articulate how empty, how broken i feel.
i struggle sometimes, i'm too much &never good  enough",1
"feel creatively empty and also that i'm isolated from the people i care about and i don't know why.
like my brain is trying to fall out ",1
i'm struggling with every aspect of life. i have pulled away or trashed every relationship in my life. i'm too tired to go forward and too afraid to stop moving. i am alone and i've tried everything. what do i do when i do not know where to turn?,1
honestly i kind of want to quit social media altogether and disappear,1
i’m not feeling great,1
"an uncle of mine passed away today. combined with everything, i just want to curl up into a ball, cry, and maybe disappear, or not have to be me for a change.",1
"i want to disappear into a book and never come back out. 
#reading #books #booksky",1
toby…please…save us from this insanity…i can’t take it anymore…,1
"you're right, fen. i appreciate your wisdom and words. this isn't about that, and i can't really talk about what it is. 

i'm just tired, and i feel empty.",1
i really can’t take it anymore,1
"always  it was about 6 and half months ago i started hrt, before that i felt the emptyness and that just something wasn't right all the time, just not feeling. now that feels like a lifetime ago. i get to be me now and i've never been happier.",1
"i'm trying to learn how to hope again this year. 

but i have to tell y'all, it's genuinely scary. 

burying all of my desires and dreams protected me for so long, i don't really know how to do this anymore. maybe i'll start by admitting something to you here: 

i want to be wanted. and pursued.",1
"i should probably get up but i don't want to.... i'm still so tired of everything.
but i'm also hungry. i want to test out the cold weather gear at some point too.
but i'm so tired and drained.
i feel guilty that i've been doing so little lately but i'm also in a constant state of can't deal",1
"i’m going about my day, but i’m not all here. it’s as if i am outside of my body observing and experiencing everything i do at some kind of distance. it’s like the signals between body and soul have encountered interference. i don’t feel what i normally do, kinda just numb and tired.",1
"maybe if i grind out a little more time, my work will come back with everything i've asked for and we can try to set it right. but i don't have a good feeling about that. but searching a new job and starting over is just more fights. i'm so tired of fighting. i just wanna live.",1
"once again feeling bad, dumb and useless",1
"i feel weird today. kind of empty and alone. i want to have more thoughts about it, but i can't generate them.",1
"just getting worn down by the frustration of having to pay a quarter of my income to go to the job that i need so that i can pay half my income to avoid homelessness, and then still go into the red every month because the other quarter of my income doesn't cover everything else.

and i'm so tired.",1
huh why do i feel empty,1
i feel so empty? i dunno. unwanted maybe...,1
"the thing they don't really tell you about direct grief is how utterly paralyzing it is. i'm going through the motions and doing the things i need to do, but my heart is just empty and i feel pointless. 
and of course *gestures wildly* none of this helps either.",1
"ill admit, i am starting to feel real fucking useless screaming into the internet void.
i want to quit my fuckin job and go to dc, live outside the capital in a state of 24/7protest.
the phone calls/boycotts etc arent helping me shake this feeling of helplessness.",1
i hate this week. monday was great and every day after that has just been getting worse. i'm so tired of everything.,1
"welp, there goes me good mood. i’m so tired of everything all at once all the time and living with my dad is not helping.",1
i can’t take it anymore!!!,1
"for years i was told so many of my problems were weight related and lol nope. never were. i hate that that’s still something they blame everything on. i stop listening if they say it now. 

but yeah i’m also constantly tired and if sucks so much.",1
"i need to say it and then i’ll shut up:

i’m so tired of being in pain. it affects everything i do. some days i cry in the car, some days i’m rude to strangers, some days i scream into pillows. i never let it show & 95% of those closest to me don’t know i’m suffering. 

ok, back to warrior mode.

",1
i seriously feel so empty in the pit of my stomach right now.  so hard to process…,1
i am on break but i still feel so so so empty and so hollow and when will this feeling end,1
i feel empty and deflated,1
i can’t take it anymore!!!!,1
"i'm not feeling great today, idk why. negative spoons, can't carry on a conversation. i'll respond to people later tonight or probably tomorrow ",1
"i keep feeling pretty broken, useless and like this will just make me even more undesirable.

hard to really get my confidence out of the gutter.",1
"i'm sorry y'all, but i'm probably going to cancel today's stream. i got some things going on and i'm just not feeling great.",1
my brain isn't in the best place right now - i have a lot going on that i'm having to deal with (most of it not my causing but still my responsibility). i really just want to disappear and be invisible.,1
i want to make it disappear. or watch it disappear again and again,1
"it's fucking terrifying. i'm tired of always having to struggle so hard. i was out of anything to give over a decade ago.

everything since has just been piling burnout on top of burnout, & i'll probably never recover any of the parts of me i held dear & lost.

i am so tired. i just want to be safe.",1
"god, i can't imagine how empty and pathetic it must feel to be these people. i'm so sorry.",1
what's the point of having a vent account if i'm just gonna crawl up and cry in my bed all day instead,1
idek how to explain it. i like interacting with my current moots. but thinking about establishing myself again here is just soooo tiring. the scariest part is it makes me want to just quit. leave. disappear.,1
"well, today has been one of the worst mornings i've ever had. nothing i do seems to be working right. fuck man, nothing i've been trying to do has worked right for years now at this point. gods i'm so tired and need a win so bad man. fuck. everything just sucks and is so bleak right now.",1
"sometimes i want to disappear and be very strong in my own, very hidden corner.",1
"i still don't reeeeeally want to be here and i'm thinking i'm just gonna...

not try? i guess?? i'm tired of being. i'm tired of no one actually giving a shit.",1
i miss gabe so fucking much. i feel so empty without him...,1
starting a treatment couldn’t come soon enough. i am so much pain today. my skin hurts.  everything hurts. i’m tired of interrupting my life and it is making me so cranky all the time. i’d rather be in a good mood so let’s get to the getting better.,1
i'm really trying to hold on to not vent right now. i'm so so tired of everything.,1
i feel so burnt out on life. my birthday is next month and i told eric that all i want is to disappear into the woods. no people. just me and him. maybe some blunts. maybe som painting. i just want to go be in the woods and away.,1
the past two months have felt like a horrible hallucination i want 2 snap out of it but i don’t think i can i don’t know what day it is it’s all blended 2gether i can’t take it anymore,1
i’m tired of everything,1
this is the worst. i just want to escape. i just want to run. i want a complete reset. i'm sorry for publicizing this episode but i just can't take bottling it up anymore.,1
if i could go one day without feeling like i want to have a mental breakdown that would be great,1
"negative self talk is such a bitch for real… i’ve been feeling horrible the whole day! yesterday and the day before was great but today didn’t do anything of the things i wanted to do and now of course i feel even more like shit because i’m a failure. 
i just want to feel good for longer…",1
i don't want to go to school anymore. i don't even have enough will to want to get up from bed and move around and exist. all i want is to just randomly disappear with the memory of me gone from everyone's heads so maybe i could fix all that i've done,1
"so now every time i do something good, i just feel so empty, i feel like i haven’t done anything even if i’ve worked hard, so it’s kind of hard to feel like i should do anything anymore. i depend on others too fucking much it’s crazy i just want to feel whole inside, by myself, without anyone else.",1
"does anyone else find it impossible to make friends or find a partner?

i feel so alone in this.

now theres going to be someone that says ""but you have over 10000 followers here""

it's not the same.

i struggle alone in this, even in the autistic online community.

thanks for reading.",1
"i am so tired of everything.

going to try and finish writing this chapter today.

"♡ ♡ look that’s it, i can’t take this anymore. i’m getting high and going babie mode ",1
i am awake and feeling like trash today. i am still incredibly upset about what happened last night. of all the things i prepared myself for apparently the game making me throw up didn't register on my radar and it should have given my stomach issues. it was not a great way to end my birthday. ,1
"i can’t stand you.
i can’t take it anymore.",1
what i need is an out. i'm tired of it all and want all my worries to just disappear forever.,1
"want to go out but it'll be the same as it always is. shut off, dead to others, unable to speak because the words i want to say disappear before they can reach my mouth",1
"i'm just venting, i'm tired of drama, tired of everything

just play game, stare at nice booba and cock and ass, fuck the haters",1
"i just can't take it anymore.

i just don't care.",1
i think i'm going through some burnout with everything... i have to manage college assignments on top of a full time job and this summer class was a mess and the spring semester was an awful experience. i feel so tired,1
well go from one thing to another...woke up with my throat feeling weird and my voice is barely coming out...great...,1
"yeah, i've had to hide things that i don't want to suddenly disappear, but are too large for me to take home when i go visit. ",1
so hard. omg. every day that goes by....i can't take it anymore,1
i have fucked up on such an astronomical asshole level that i want to disappear for a long time and don’t deserve any friends.,1
 sometimes you can just wake up and get hit with a deep aching sadness that roots in your chest like a stubborn weed despite it all. even thought theres nothing actually wrong with today and that i shouldnt even be sad? why should i be depressed? i have so much to be happy for,1
"yes it is!!

and i'm tired of it.

i'm tired of being terrified that my next check won't come and i'll lose everything.",1
"yesterday was great, got a lot of stuff done, let nothing and no one take away my happiness, got my halloween costume sorted, and i'm still feeling great today. going to keep refusing to let things take away my happiness.",1
feeling the same today rave bean  i just want to disappear  sending you any positive vibes i can muster ,1
"everything feels so pointless and empty. i don't need a purpose to live, i don't need a reason, but i do need company. i feel like i'm just fading, rotting, vanishing from the world. i feel so fucking isolated. at least before i knew you i didn't know what it was like to be seen for who i was.",1
"it took a lot of muting and one random block but i think my feeds are mostly safe again. idk when i’ll unmute a lot of it. if ever. but right now for my mental health, this is what i have to do. i’ve spent the past 5 years fighting, not to mention everything before that, and i’m just damn tired.",1
i hope i at least like feeling great,1
"hey, good morning people. hope you have a good day and a nice weekend

i've kinda had conflicting thoughts lately, i feel like i want to return to twitter again. not because i like it, no not at all. but mainly it seems most friends don't really care about this place and it kinda feels empty.",1
"i know that major depressive disorder is common enough that society doesn't typically think about it as a disability, but this round sure has been disabling for me. i feel like i can't do anything anymore and when i can it takes me burning five times the energy that it used to",1
one of the many reasons i’m trying to leave twitter.  can’t take it anymore.,1
everything is so bad right now. i really wish i didn't have to be here. i don't want to live through this. i never asked to be here.,1
i feel empty,1
"i feel empty, lonely, unwanted, and abandoned. no one really wants to talk to me anymore. i always get the vibe that people are just humoring me, but really they think i'm annoying and try to get rid of me as fast as they can.""",1
"depressed people depress people? 
gee, thanks. now i'm even more depressed.",1
it feels so bad. i feel like i should be making something everyday or else im useless but at the same time my brain is like :) no u will do nothing :),1
i’m tired of feeling like i have to brave everything out alone every time i get the courage to let my guard down and start depending on people. really starting to think i’d be happier if i moved far away from everyone and everything i know and just allow myself to truly be alone.,1
omg my cat <sigh> the angst. the pain. the emptyness. ugh,1
"i feel blue, and no one else understands why, because i don't understand too.

sometimes i just want to disappear.",1
i just… i’m tired of trying to see the bright side. i don’t even need good things to happen i just need the bad stuff to take some time off. i don’t know how much more i can deal with and i’m tired of fighting to keep my head above water when everything seems to be trying to hold me under.,1
"thank you so much for talking about this because i’m literally in my dysphoria blues today and it’s exactly this. adults forgetting that i’m still a child, strangers commenting on my body, the feeling like i want to disappear so i’m not perceived but at the same time knowing no one really sees me ",1
and what happens when i can’t take it anymore?,1
i'm so fucking tired of everything today,1
i'm so fuckinf. tired vro and my mum is mocking me for it i can't take it anymore ,1

"i don’t want to be here.  i want to delete this from my phone.  an app that keeps me in fear.  fear of what awful danger he might unleash.  if i don’t have this it may be missed.  
isn’t that what being a hostage is?  today has been the worst so far since the election.  i’m just sad.",1
