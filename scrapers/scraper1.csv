In the first panel is a closeup of his hand holding a bunch of pills. The narration says “I held 100’ish pills in my hand that night. Frankly it’s a miracle I didn’t take them.”

In the second panel we see his face, tired and worn down looking with large dark circles under his eyes as he looks at the pills in his hand. The narration says “The main thing that stopped me was that it didn’t feel fair to my friends.”

In the third panel he’s sitting on his bed, which has bedsheet covered in stars, eating a meal consisting of a takeaway cheeseburger and fries. The narration says “I suppose it’d also be awfully convenient to the worst people in the world if I did die. That wasn’t it, though.”

In the fourth panel he’s mostly coveted by his duvet as he’s laid down in bed, his eyes tiredly peeking over the edge. The narration says “Existing out of spite couldn’t have kept me around.

Usually, the legs are most prominently affected. Those affected may fidget, rock back and forth, or pace, while some may just have an uneasy feeling in their body. The most severe cases may result in poor adherence to medications, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, and, because of this, aggression, violence, and/or suicidal thoughts.","1535","1320","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:syucwtdg6qk7agtzlgnzxnzd/bafkreiezoqlgotfa6t6b5xzo3mcoeselyk3veljx77hkd4tllwaq4jau4i@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:syucwtdg6qk7agtzlgnzxnzd/bafkreiezoqlgotfa6t6b5xzo3mcoeselyk3veljx77hkd4tllwaq4jau4i@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:syucwtdg6qk7agtzlgnzxnzd/bafkreiezoqlgotfa6t6b5xzo3mcoeselyk3veljx77hkd4tllwaq4jau4i@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","1","0","Day 2 of yet another epilepsy drug increase.

Summary:
Cavendish was born the son of a nobleman, but he'd been raised the son of a hunter. And he had never forgotten his first lesson.

*“They're cursed. Damned. Forced to feed on the blood of living men to sustain themselves. They can't eat, can't drink, can't sleep. It's a horror of an existence, Cavendish, and what we do is a mercy.”*

Even as a child, he had envied them.

*“They can’t eat, can’t drink, can’t sleep.”*

He’d never known a life alone in his body.

*“…can’t sleep.”*","1476","1029","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreic6jfnoduca3375pkt5id5ub75yrgz74mclmhb3nzzpho2es3srse@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreic6jfnoduca3375pkt5id5ub75yrgz74mclmhb3nzzpho2es3srse@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreic6jfnoduca3375pkt5id5ub75yrgz74mclmhb3nzzpho2es3srse@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","1","0","""Bloodletting""

Rampage is on his knees, draped over transmutate's lap in the first panel. she is patting his shoulder.

Had I simply understood that life has no meaning might have accepted it peacefully, knowing that it was my lot. But I could not be calmed by this. If I had been like a man in a wood from which he knows there is no way out, I might have been able to live; but I was like a man in a wood who is lost, and terrified by this rushes around hoping to find his way out, knowing that with each step he is getting more lost, and yet unable to stop rushing about. 
It was all quite dreadful. And so, in order to escape from this horror, I wanted to kill myself. I felt a horror of what lay ahead of me and knew that this horror was worse than my present position, but I could neither drive it away nor patiently await the end. However convincing the argument that said a blood vessel of the heart would collapse anyway, or that something would burst and it would all be over, I could not wait for the end with composure. The horror of the darkness was too great and I wanted to escape from it as quickly as possible by means of a rope or a bullet. It was this feeling that lured me, more strongly than anything else, towards suicide.

I'm optimistic about myself, our movements, my job, our members, and the future of the human race.

Hi. Advice Needed So, I'm currently pregnant, about 6 months along, and my husband has been doing this thing every time we go to a doctor appointment. He'll drive me to the appointment, then when I'm about to get in the car, he drives forward a little, then reverses, then drives forward again. He does this a few times, and it always frustrates me. He thinks it's hilarious and says he's just ""messing with me"". I started to get really frustrated. I'm already dealing with the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy, and this just feels like him poking fun at me when I'm already tired and stressed. I told him it bothers me, but he just brushed it off and said I'm overreacting","1081","869","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreibkni6opmwmz2t6izrsxbl3avqezkrpvbys3ceswztdxc72z3y2mi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreibkni6opmwmz2t6izrsxbl3avqezkrpvbys3ceswztdxc72z3y2mi@jpeg","We had a big fight about it the other day. I tried to explain how it's making me feel, and he got defensive, saying I need to lighten up and that it's ""just a joke."" I told him it wasn't funny anymore and it wasn't something I wanted to deal with during my pregnancy. The final straw was when he did it again before a doctor appointment yesterday, and I was just done. I ended up calling my mom to take me instead and told my husband he was banned from all future appointments. Well, now he's furious. He's demanding to be there for the next appointment because it's the one where we'll find out the baby's gender. He says this is a huge moment and I'm being unfair by not letting him come. I told him I need him to respect my boundaries, and this is one of the ways I'm doing that. But he keeps insisting that it's just a silly little thing, and now he's calling me unreasonable for making a big deal out of it. am I overreacting here","1031","829","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreihrbpyx4g55lapih6e7wrz5poupoanrhgax5lovmyud7akubop5wa@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreihrbpyx4g55lapih6e7wrz5poupoanrhgax5lovmyud7akubop5wa@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"213",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreibkni6opmwmz2t6izrsxbl3avqezkrpvbys3ceswztdxc72z3y2mi@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I'm so tired","56","9","Oh hell no.

Ghost Walks is my largest collection of poetry to date. This book gathers about five years worth of poetry scattered about in sketchbooks and my notes app. They come to me a lot while I'm in my head, lost within a feeling. I like to call them 'ghost walks,' since they feel like I've gone somewhere and nowhere- hence the title.

This is a digital, incomplete version of the book, which will continue to be updated. Thank you for supporting my work, and I hope you enjoy.

Sie trägt ein gelbes Shirt und dunkle Hosen. Der Garten, den sie malt, besteht aus einer Vielzahl von Blumen und Pflanzen, hauptsächlich in Violett-, Rosa- und Grüntönen. Diese Farben heben sich wunderschön von einem hellen Korallenhintergrund ab.

Das Gemälde vermittelt den Eindruck, als ob das Mädchen den Garten mit ihren Pinselstrichen zum Leben erweckt. Das Werk ist an einer weißen Wand montiert.

Summary: The sun streams through Sanji's window bright and early, rousing him from sleep.
He yawns as he rouses. He didn't quite remember what he dreamed about last night, but it was a good one, he thinks. He was happy and content in it and very sad that it's over.
He turns and reaches across the bed for his bed partner, ""Morning, sleepy Mar-""
He stops when his hand hits nothing but air and blankets.
That's right. He was sleeping alone. He always sleeps alone. Why would he assume anything different?
Or: a day in the life of the retired Blackleg Sanji and his house guest.

When I say this project hasn't cost me anything, you have to realize that I am generally a believer in the bygones principle, which states that whatever happened in the past to get you to your current situation can't be changed, and the products of those decisions have to be taken at their current face value, and all that matters is what you do with what you have to work with from that point forward.

It sort of goes along with the old adage, ""Don't cry over spilled milk."" The thing is done, you can't go back and undo it, so you had better figure out how you're going to clean up the mess. And if someone else made the mess, there's no sense in blaming them until AFTER the cleanup is done. It's important, of course, to figure all that out, and hold whoever made the mess to whatever degree of responsibility is appropriate, but trying to do so while there's still a mess on the floor doesn't get you any further towards your immediate goal - which is to clean up the mess.","1200","1600","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","Grasshopper speeding over a bump, moments before the servo broke.

And you will sometimes, in the course of cleaning up messes, make mistakes. You will also encounter opposition from others who complain that you're not cleaning it up the right way, or quickly enough, or whatever. It's important to realize that such comments are useless. The way to fix things is not to sit around discussing the perfect plan of action and figure out exactly how to return everything to its precise pre-mess state; you have to work quickly to stop the mess from spreading, then clean up the bulk of it, and then you can get into the minutiae. And guess what?

Last night, I woke up and realized someone had butchered my hair. One side is a jagged pixie cut, and the other side hangs awkwardly past my shoulder. At first, I thought I was losing my mind-maybe I sleepwalked or something -but no. I confronted my husband, Tim, because he's been acting weird lately, but he denied it. Then he drops this bombshell: ""My mom... she might've done it."" Apparently, my MIL (let's call her Diane) is convinced I've been cheating on Tim. Why? Because last week, she saw me having lunch with a coworker. For the record, the coworker (Kyle) is gay and we were literally talking about work. But Diane decided I must be having an affair and, instead of, you know, talking to me or Tim, she broke into our house in the middle of the night with scissors and went full Edward Scissorhands on my hair.

Tim is horrified and apologetic, but I'm struggling here. This woman violated my personal space, destroyed my hair, and acted like she was in the right. I want to go no contact with her, but Tim is stuck between me and his mom, and I feel like this is going to be a huge blowup in our marriage. Any advice? Because I'm honestly at a loss here. TL:DR: MIL cut my hair in my sleep because she thinks I'm cheating on my husband (I'm not). Now I don't know how to handle her or my marriage. Edit: My husband and I will be going to my MIL tomorrow to talk to her about the situation again. Hopefully everyone will be calmed down by then and I won't have to threaten legal action.

Earlier, I couldn't take it anymore, so I sat him down and told him he needed to be 100% honest with me about everything. That's when he dropped the bombshell. Apparently, Diane didn't come up with the haircut idea on her own. Tim admitted that he knew about it ahead of time-and even helped her. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. He said he truly thought I was cheating on him with Kyle (my gay coworker) because Diane had convinced him that there was ""too much evidence to ignore.""

It's not just the haircut; it's the fact that he didn't talk to me, believed the worst about me without any proof, and actively participated in something so cruel and violating. As for Diane, she's officially dead to me. I've already told Tim that I don't want in my life ever again, regardless of what happens between us. Right now, I'm torn. Part of me wants to file a police report on both of them for what they did, but I'm scared of how messy it will get.

Now, Astarion finally turned to acknowledge Frans, a look of absolute disinterest on his pale face as he spoke. ""I do so wish I knew what you were saying, Frans my boy but I don't speak inbred mongrel.""

Frans goes still, breathing in and out slowly as he tried to focus on not blowing up in front of everyone but he was dangling at the end of his rope.

""Now, you can either stop barking incessantly and educate yourself on proper etiquette and sophisticated idiolect or sit back down and stay mute as I'm sure your master taught you,"" Astarion's words were like a snake, slithering off of his tongue and dripping with venom. 

Frans licked his lips and tapped his toes as he looked away. So much was going through his head right now, blurring together and making everything unfocused by swirls of anxiety, fear, grief, and anger. After a few long moments of silence, he simply raises a finger, gives it a swirl before making a zipping motion over his mouth, smiling the whole time. Next came an over exaggerated gesture with both arms as he took a little bow as if to ask if Astarion was pleased now. It all was rather sarcastic. 

Gale glanced over at his lover and grew even more concerned. The last time he snapped like this, he mutilated a nurse and it was a side of Frans that only showed up when he was extremely pissed. 

Like now. 

""That's better,"" Astarion stuck his nose up as he turned back to his drink, clearly done with this conversation and wanting to be left alone to stew.

However, he could feel the burning sensation of eyes burrowing into the back of his head seconds before he felt someone grab his hair and yank, pulling him right off of the stool and to the ground.

""For the love of...."" Astarion started to growl but Frans quickly shut him up with a swift punch to the jaw. 

After rubbing his sore jaw, Astarion looked up at Frans who simply glared down at him, not saying a word. 

","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreib34xd5y4ydl5tvozeaaltgnrpwd4jj3igvn3bnmmiqbpffm6rylm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreib34xd5y4ydl5tvozeaaltgnrpwd4jj3igvn3bnmmiqbpffm6rylm@jpeg","Frans was taking off his swords and throwing them to the side as he gave Astarion a moment to get to his feet but that was the only reprieve as he stepped forth and slugged the older man again, causing the other to stumble back a few steps.

Astarion steadied himself and then takes a moment to wipe away the faintest trail of blood leaking from his nose. As he licked the crimson stain from his thumb, he gave Frans a dangerous, almost predatory look as the thought of draining him dry and being done with it but he refrains, knowing it would do more harm than good. And besides, he didn't really want the young man dead. No. All he wanted was to be left alone to deal with this mess on his own.

Sadly, there was no going back at this point and there were far too many differences to settle before they could keep going.

In the blink of an eye the distance between them was crossed, the gap sealed as Frans rushed forward, swinging another punch that hit Astarion square in the face again and without giving the vampire a breather this time, he brings his knee up to strike him right in the gut. The wind was knocked out of the latter and he narrowly stepped out of the way of another hit. It was his turn to retaliate.

In one swift motion, Astarion side steps Frans and fluidly brings his hand down to grab the young rogue's side, right where he had been slashed.  His clawed fingers dig into the raw flesh, breaking through the dried blood and spilling a fresh stream onto the floor as he burrowed deep.

Frans let out a gasp but manages to hold back a shout as he grits his teeth. He makes an attempt to collect himself and strike back but Astarion caught the swing this time and twists the wrist within his grasp, causing sharp pain to shoot up the appendage. Unfortunately for one of them, the vampire spawn was the only one who came out of their previous battle in better shape and he also had his heightened abilities, so it was looking to be in his favor at the moment.

""Do not test me, boy,"" Astarion snarled as he pulled Frans close, getting right in his face. ""A rapid mutt deserves to be put down.""

Frans flared his nostrils and pursed his lips angrily but wastes no time in throwing his head back and bringing it forward with full force. As his forehead makes contact, he could feel Astarion's nose crack from the impact. The pressure on his side instantly vanishes and he stumbles back, breathing heavily as he sucks in air to combat the blazing pain. As he looked back at Astarion, he was still seeing red but from the blood dripping down his face this time. 

Astarion was silent for a moment, registering what just happenee before looking at Frans with both befuddlement and rage. ""You fucking little cunt!""

""Foehckin kess me arse, ya fanged bastard!"" Frans retorted back with just as much venom. ""I might be a dahg boeht you're a coward and a useless foehck who's ahnly good fahr a good snahg. Get bent!""

""Oh, that's rich coming from you,"" Astarion retorted back, cackling dryly. ""I don't have a choice who's penis I put in my mouth. Your mother on the other hand? I can only imagine how many she begged to stroke.""

Now, Astarion was just being nasty, fighting with his words to trip Frans up where he knew the young lad felt the most. It did the trick though and Frans lunged at him, ready to strangle the other man with his bare hands if he had to. But he misses as the former sidesteps and causes him to stumble and nearly lose balance.

The smirk pulling at Astarion's lips was cruel and cold as he stepped away, crimson gaze following Frans as he continueed to taunt him. ","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreiflpbz7hyshxbvzaskxiqw726ab4demupco24spwxkbmffb2762ua@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreiflpbz7hyshxbvzaskxiqw726ab4demupco24spwxkbmffb2762ua@jpeg","""You know, that reminds me of this stray cat that used to live outside of my room growing up. She was always in heat. Gods know how many filthy kittens she had that never made it. Now..."" his smirk grew, fangs glistening with the scarlet sheen of his own blood. ""I wonder how many babies your mother dumped before you?""

That was the last straw.

Frans was going to kill him.

This time when rushing him, Frans finally made contact, tackling Astarion to the ground. A few good hits were landed that would surely leave deep bruises and minor lacerations, on both the vampire face and the half-elf's knuckles. For a moment Astarion's vision blurred and his ears rang with each impact, dazing him which allowed Frans to break his nose once again. A few intense healing spells would be needed to realign it after this.

""Dahn't! Foehckin! Bring! Me! Moehm! Into! Dis!"" Frans was practically shouting now, pissed beyond reason. In fact, he was so angry, tears pricking at the corners of his eyes were now rolling down his cheeks. Intrusive thoughts fueled by rage took over and he stopped swinging, instead wrapping his hands around Astarion's neck and squeezing as hard as he could. ""Ya can talk shet abooeht me all you want boeht leave me moehm ooeht o' yooehr felthy, lyin mooehth!""

Astarion gagged, choking on the air as his windpipe was forcfulily closed. Thankfully, he didn't require much air if at all but the act did throw him off and out of bodily reflex, he started to claw at Frans's hands.

""Dahn't you foehckin dare! She was a lahvin wahman who cared! Ya dahn't get to say shet abooeht 'er! Naht when yer a selfesh, oehncarin peg! Aku's foehckin dyin and ya dahn't even give a shet!

Don't bring a kiss to a knife fight.
Roadkill. Violent. Brash. Obsessive. In the closet.
Clyde. Cunning. Ruthless. Biker royalty. Trapped on the other side of the same closet.
Roadkill.
I've hated Clyde Turner since the moment I laid eyes on him. I hate him for existing, for tempting me, for being everything I can't have.
Ice-blue eyes, a cocky smirk that makes my fists itch, a damn Hell's Butchers MC prince. I want him violently, but since I can't have him, I will destroy him. I killed his f*cking brother, and he's next.
When a fire traps us together, death feels inevitable.
With no way out and nothing left to lose, we trade confessions like poison-laced promises.
I say I wish l'd f*cked him. Just to break him. Just to see disgust twist his perfect face.
His reply is like a bullet.
""I would have let you...""
Clyde.
I should've burned to death in that fire, because now my worst nightmare has come true. Roadkill knows.
He knows the secret I've spent years burying beneath blood, alcohol, and loyalty to my club.
I have to kill him. There's no other way.
But a knife fight leads to kisses and a deal struck in the dark. We'll keep it quiet. No one needs to know.
Enemies with benefits, nothing more. A stolen moment here, a touch there, with no strings and no club betrayal.","2000","1031","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:elm4uz3xagykz66qcze2772d/bafkreiagyh5zkeqxl56gng6ezjtp7ehbsp7efbaystrjjsvnfgad47sc2u@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:elm4uz3xagykz66qcze2772d/bafkreiagyh5zkeqxl56gng6ezjtp7ehbsp7efbaystrjjsvnfgad47sc2u@jpeg","Until one of us is dead, I'll let myself fall into his bed, and in the meanwhile, I'll keep looking for the bastard who killed my brother.
The aftermath.
Nothing stays buried forever. Not secrets, not sins, and certainly not feelings. What starts as a forbidden tryst becomes something deeper. No matter how far we run, the shadows of our clubs and the weight of our hatred threaten to destroy us.
Some things you can't come back from.

The lecture assignments give us a brief introduction to the material before we learn it in class.
I liked the knowledge of the instructor and their ability to explain concepts.
The instructor is very engaging and funny. He keeps lectures entertaining while also keeping them very informative and
helpful. The course is well put together with every topic building on the last.
I enjoyed the enthusiasm brought to every lecture and how the material was presented each week.
The satisfaction that comes to completing an assignment.
I liked the passion he put into teaching the material, he did tend to get onto students for being on their phone or not working on
lecture material, but you could tell he really wanted us to learn.
The instructor makes an effort to keep students engaged during lectures, and he generally seems very invested in students'
learning.
I enjoyed his creativity and engagement in the class. I found it very fun to watch some of those lecture prep videos that he
made, especially more towards the beginning. His fast pace helped me stay focused on the lecture more. Also, he protects
the classroom environment fiercely, taking student's devices from them if they are caught doing something unrelated to class.
I liked a lot of the jokes the instructor put into things and their personality as well as how available people were to answer
questions on discord.

(continued)
Spend less time in class overexplaining simple concepts, drop the preoccupation with technology usage during class time –
stopping class to point it out and go to take the technology from the student is FAR more distracting than the student's use of
technology would have been otherwise, on that note – don't treat students like they are children – this may be a generally
freshmen class but they're not highschoolers anymore, lastly, introduce new concepts in lectures where they can be explained
rather than in problem sets so the students don't have to teach themselves the concepts.
The lectures are very rambling and I do not feel they helped me learn. The style of asking students questions about work they
don't understand whenever they asked for help did not help me learn, it only made me feel as if I was talking to a brick wall
each time I reached out for help on more complicated subjects. In my other coding classes, the instructor would show us a
problem, work through it with us, and explain why his solution worked. Then, he would give us a problem of our own to solve,
allowing us to apply the skills he had just taught us. He would always be available to help and he explained why our solutions
weren't working if we got stuck. I vastly prefer this mode of teaching when compared to Shen's style of asking the students
questions about their work/problem that they don't know how to...",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zbsrqohlky764hfi3wb2qixt/bafkreifnkh4pix3fi5o5igwiblwczymbhxbyyieosp4gsbafxrm34t4wtq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zbsrqohlky764hfi3wb2qixt/bafkreifnkh4pix3fi5o5igwiblwczymbhxbyyieosp4gsbafxrm34t4wtq@jpeg","What did you like least about this course and instructor?
I disliked how they called out people who were not focused and then would complain about having to pause class. The
assignments to do in groups were too little work for such large groups.
Most of the learning was done outside of the class on the homework assignments and the lectures were mainly to clarify
things and answer questions.
I disliked the heavy workload, some lectures/problem sets felt irrelevant to the exam material. Additionally sometimes in
lecture the attitude brought when a student was on a device or minding their own business was a bit much.
Discussions within groups felt monitored; I understand making sure we are on task, but once again, we're college students. If
we aren't understanding something, it's on us to reach out and use resources. Whole class discussions didn't feel great; if
you responded wrong, you got shunned. Made much of the class feel unwilling to share thoughts. Led to 10 minute
discussions where no one would talk and the professor would just stare at us. When groups answered wrong, they were
made as an example. Dreaded lecture class for these reasons.
The class simultaneously feels as if it is infantilizing you, yet pressuring you to do assignments with knowledge you have yet
to learn. Your devices are taken away, you are not allowed to talk at all in class (unless in discussion, then it must be on topic)

I would stop pausing class too call out people who were on their phones and focus on the teaching. I think the group work did
not go well with the lecture setting and was hard to include everyone.
Maybe some more depth in lecture compared to the majority of learning occurring in the out of class lecture assignments,
since it felt like I learned everything online vs in the classroom.
There's a few things I could suggest here. First, stop taking away college students phones and laptops. If someone wants to
sit there and not participate in class, that is honestly on that student. From elementary school to high school, I would
understand why you'd want to do this; to encourage participation and help students get interested in the topic. However, your
students are now adults, and taking away their devices just leads to a lack of trust and disdain for the instructor, not a
motivation to learn and participate more. Secondly, rework your worksheets in lecture. From what I understand, the point of the
worksheets is for the team to work together to create code to solve the problem. However, groups can be anywhere from 2–7
people, and the size of the group heavily changes how effective these worksheets are. My first group consisted of 6 people,
and people slowly stopped coming because they didn't have anything to contribute to these worksheets that wasn't already
said, and the lectures often were re...",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zbsrqohlky764hfi3wb2qixt/bafkreifntg63j4wyifheaavtklbijfbf4rnblovu4iulykt6bmf6yjo4su@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zbsrqohlky764hfi3wb2qixt/bafkreifntg63j4wyifheaavtklbijfbf4rnblovu4iulykt6bmf6yjo4su@jpeg","en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zbsrqohlky764hfi3wb2qixt/bafkreiha4yrdwdcwxvxtzhlhpjzngoc26ngpklkvjxt2z32kxb6zc66dru@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I just want everything to stop","0","0","The student evaluations are in!","https://bsky.app/profile/ccshan.woof.group.ap.brid.gy/post/3lesjelner662"

You really need someone that knows how to work social media. I've been coming to your restaurant since you opened. I've done birthdays and other holidays there, and other times. I've been a loyal customer, even friends that have worked there. Your posts just come across as hostile, and frankly, unhinged. Despite that, no matter that you are introducing a new menu and I want to try it, I can't bring myself to go again. The vitriol you spew is just too much.

Tom Grieshaber Ohhhhh you're going to stop now. And everyone you know.
It's all over for us because goddamn it you said these things on the internet.
And social media no less.
And I'm ummmmm mad / upset / disconsolate / hey maybe I can say something in your business page that sounds smarter than you / how can this guy possibly get away with this shit while I've done everything 'right' by the rules / hey pleeeeease I'm the real authority who knows here.

This is an exemplar. Of things you've never thought of.
And your little world of things you've been told to accept and think are great... never were.
You were relentlessly propagandized for a decade and a half to believe what is even
'good' is what a certain kind of person can write about and perform to gain credibility and possibly even authority from other people who do not live here and they're wannabes too. And also talentless.

Vim’s cheeks grew hot and he rested his chin on top of Ptem’s head so he couldn’t see him blush. “I uh—I was just really excited to play with you and I didn’t want to stop to remove them,” he admitted shyly.

“I’ll take that as a compliment. I ask because you have a really nice body and I’m sure the parts that I still haven’t seen are nice as well,” Ptem said.  

Vim wasn’t certain how to respond to that. No one had ever told him he looked like someone who had a nice cock before.

I’ll remember not to do that again.”

Vim laughed at that, “Love, I have put far worse things in my mouth. It’s fine. Could you teach me that spell though? It’s incredibly useful.”

“I can show you how I cast it, if that would help. It might work differently for you though because you said that casting requires—you’d have to ask Erathis for lube,” Ptem said as he realized what the spell would involve for Vim.

Vim felt his face grow warm at the thought of asking his god for such a thing. “You know what actually, maybe it’s better I don’t. I can just go to a shop. It’s fine,” Vim said quickly.

“You could trade her for it. She gives you fresh lube and you give her your used condom. That seems fair to me,” Ptem joked.

When they’d had nowhere else to go and resorted to having sex in a cave, Vim had used his sacred flame spell to dispose of his condom and explained to Ptem that he asked Erathis t",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:fxidvnqdncecdebgqcfotcem/bafkreihyvupuky65mfvbowmnicaachn7klhidrdnbaigubhkqyfamw2p4q@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:fxidvnqdncecdebgqcfotcem/bafkreihyvupuky65mfvbowmnicaachn7klhidrdnbaigubhkqyfamw2p4q@jpeg","He glanced over to the night stand where the incense he’d lit during his prayers had burned itself out. Its heady, familiar scent still filled the room. He closed his eyes to finish his evening prayers with his arms still wrapped around Ptem.

He thanked Erathis once again for sparing him Draconia’s fate. As painful as living with so much loss was, and as lost as he himself was, he never would have met Ptem if he’d fallen as well. He thanked her for leading him to Ptem and prayed he wouldn’t fuck things up this time. He prayed to keep Ptem in his life. He was so afraid of losing him to time prison or the dangers of war or his own stupidity.

He prayed for Ptem as well. He asked Erathis to watch over him and help her manage the pain he carried. He prayed that one day soon she’d begin to see just how impressive he was; that he’d see how deserving she was of love and praise.

My heart shattered with my country and my people. It’s not worth anything to anyone.”

Ptem considered Vim’s concerns. If Vim thought that both outcomes would result in them being harmed, then they might as well give in to their hearts and be together as they both wanted. Just as she had told Ama earlier that night, not being with Vim already hurt her and he couldn’t imagine that being with Vim could feel worse than the ache in his heart from believing that he didn’t love her, or the tears he shed while Vim slept because she thought he would never be hers.

“Your heart is worth everything to me. Even if it’s shattered, it’s still yours and I want it more than anything, if you would share it with me,” Ptem said.

Republicans forced us to debate their billionaire bailout budget framework. We started voting at 6 PM because they knew doing it in the dark of night would minimize media coverage. 
And they do not want the American people to see how blatant their handover of our government to the billionaire class is. So I want to explain what happened last night and what we did to fight back. 
The apex of Republicans' plan to turn over our government to their wealthy cronies is a giant tax cut for billionaires and corporations. And they plan to pay for it with cuts to programs that working people rely on. 
Popular and necessary programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP, are all being targeted. 
In order to pass the tax cut, Republicans have to go through a series of procedural steps. Last night, they took the first step which requires them to pass an outline of their plan, but with it, any senator can offer as many amendments as we want. So my Democratic colleagues and I did just that.
 Now, we knew that Republicans would largely unanimously oppose them, but we had two objectives here. One, Republicans were forced to put their opinion on record - many for the first time - on the most corupt parts of Trump and Musk's agenda. Two, as I've been saying, I am going to make every process and procedure as slow and painful as possible for as long as my colleagues choose to ignore the constitutional crisis happening before our eyes. 
So what did we propose? We proposed no tax cuts for anyone who makes a billion dollars a year. We made them vote on whether or not Elon Musk and DOGE should have limitless access to Americans' personal data. We made them vote on whether to protect IVF and require insurers to cover it.
Every single amendment Democrats proposed was shot down. On almost every single amendment, Republicans universally opposed it Every Republican voted against our proposal to prevent more tax cuts for billionaires.

They are offering tax cut to the most wealthy that is 850 times larger than what they are offering working people. 
Oh and by the way, any tax cuts for working people are going to be washed out by higher costs for basic necessities, like health care and food. It's a fundamental injustice.
Thanks to your pressure and support, many of my Democratic colleagues have joined my effort to do everything we can to make sure they cannot destroy democracy and steal your money in the dark of the night. We are being loud about what is happening. I'm going to continue to grind the gears of Congress down as much as possible to make it that much harder and slower to get away with this corruption. That's why the votes lasted until nearly 5 AM. 
This a five-alarm fire. I don't think we have two years to plan and fight back. I think we have months. 
It's still in our power to stop the destruction of our democracy with mass mobilization and effective opposition from elected officials. So we can't miss any opportunity to take advantage of opportunities to put Republicans on the record and shine a light on what is happening. 
And you have a role to play in this as well. I need you to amplify what's happening, support the leaders who are fighting for you to make sure they can continue speaking truth to power against Musk and Trump's billionaire cronies, and show up at rallies and town halls. 
Use every tool at your disposal to send a message loud and clear about how you expect my colleagues to lead and fight in this moment.

When one twin was diagnosed with a genetic disorder that is almost always fatal, she and her husband struggled to get clear guidance from medical professionals. No one would even say the word abortion out loud. “We would have genetic counselors—so, people who don’t even give abortions; they just counsel on options—get midway through a sentence and then just stop, just scared to say more,” Miller told me.
Then one genetic counselor, who had lived and worked in New York, let slip that in cases like these, doctors would usually perform a procedure called a “single fetal reduction.” Miller asked what that meant.","855","1443","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreifcy4jxxsejpihqywjqij6qdkmzv7ydyl4j2y5pwylns4qssai4f4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreifcy4jxxsejpihqywjqij6qdkmzv7ydyl4j2y5pwylns4qssai4f4@jpeg","“She immediately clammed up and she started apologizing; you could tell she was scared,” Miller said. “It was truly like we had Greg Abbott, Ken Paxton, and, you know, other politicians, Texas Supreme Court justices, just sitting in that room taking notes, chewing on a pen cap right there with us.”
Miller decided to have the single fetal reduction—aborting one fetus—to protect her health and that of the other twin. Afraid to leave a paper trail, she told friends in a group text of the diagnosis, but not about her plans. She had a quick, careful phone conversation with a friend who was a gynecologic oncologist, who recommended a doctor in Colorado. As she spoke over the phone with the Colorado doctor, Miller noticed that he made sure to say explicitly that he was not in the state of Texas.","755","1414","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreie7bwtduv7qaql5nf5ba37nsyzszowrvwbq6lvofhx47j4ejhashi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreie7bwtduv7qaql5nf5ba37nsyzszowrvwbq6lvofhx47j4ejhashi@jpeg","At a party with friends that fall, Miller and her husband were careful not to mention that they were going to Colorado. “Who was there who would overhear and report us because they want that $10,000?” Miller said. “We didn’t know everybody who was at the house that evening.”
They also worried about the logistics of their trip. “The first question,” Miller said, was “what kind of digital footprint are we leaving? Do we leave our phones behind? Do we drive? Do we do everything in cash?” Because of her severe nausea, she didn’t think she would make it 12 hours in a car from Dallas to Colorado, and she was concerned about driving through rural Texas on her way to get an abortion at 14 weeks pregnant, especially if she ended up in an emergency room. She decided to fly.
Miller was perhaps more fearful than she needed to be about her trip to Colorado...Still... or do when they noticed there was only one heartbeat instead of two?","1212","1392","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreihye3um6zkrkfbis5noctcntbslvzjlz4gdnfeqdowqivtofwav7a@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreihye3um6zkrkfbis5noctcntbslvzjlz4gdnfeqdowqivtofwav7a@jpeg","The procedure went well. Miller’s severe nausea subsided, and the remainder of her pregnancy was smooth. She delivered a healthy baby in March 2023. As it turned out, Miller’s doctor in Dallas, Austin Dennard, had also recently fled Texas for an abortion because of a pregnancy complication of her own. Miller recalled that at her first appointment with the doctor after her abortion, Dennard simply said, in a formal tone, “There is only one heart rate. I will note in your file that there is an intrauterine fetal demise of one twin.” The two women later joined a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sought to set clear standards for exceptions to the state’s abortion ban. This past May, the Texas Supreme Court issued a ruling leaving the vague exceptions language intact.","724","1361","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreibrgz22igwff4jz64jwf2nevcxshftq47a5tkhhrufyry6wihgh6q@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreibrgz22igwff4jz64jwf2nevcxshftq47a5tkhhrufyry6wihgh6q@jpeg","en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3nxmlsrlnbfdgosikhqqj7m/bafkreifcy4jxxsejpihqywjqij6qdkmzv7ydyl4j2y5pwylns4qssai4f4@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I just want everything to stop","0","0","An excerpt demonstrating the extreme (and justified) paranoia that the state is causing pregnant women in need of medical care.

What happens to love when people die? Where does it go?
Don’t you understand? It’s still there, always, not just in your heart but woven into your memory and being–an influence that guides your thoughts and actions as you continue your path into the future.
As long as you’re alive, you cannot stop moving forward. You can pause, yes, but you cannot stop until the end of the road. But for as long as you’re alive, you will carry your memory with you as you continue to bound through time.
A heart is never truly alone. What connections you make, you must choose to strengthen or break of your own accord. But those who choose to stay, to love, to guide, to protect–cherish them.
Cherish them.

Gilding closes his eyes and feels his magic work against him, transferring power to Shokora as he grants her wish. “Please,” he says weakly, “I need another wish… Something to keep me from falling into despair.”
Shokora thinks for a moment and then smiles. “I wish for you to forget how close you were to me.”
“What? Wait–”
As she lets go of his hands, he grants her wish, the memories of the time they spent together slipping away.
Princess Shokora nods at Gilding and says, “Please ensure my father’s safety and the last five soldiers. I must be on my way.”
“...Yes, Your Highness.” He nods to her, feeling a sense of vague loss. “Good luck on your mission.”
“Thank you.” She stands up and gathers her things. Before leaving, she turns to him. Her smile is bright–so beautiful and radiant like the dawn–he remembers that much. And as she leaves, her cape flutters behind her.","1300","1300","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:tzygv5q2oanapnxqtpasyzz2/bafkreiflfpao3olu44ea33jdmqcxgpqlfgunz5uxq64wfdn3kt5us6e5qa@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:tzygv5q2oanapnxqtpasyzz2/bafkreiflfpao3olu44ea33jdmqcxgpqlfgunz5uxq64wfdn3kt5us6e5qa@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"1",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:tzygv5q2oanapnxqtpasyzz2/bafkreih47ve5iv6gb3qw6k6ugr6yj37z7zrhtfifmdwya5vimqs3vraj4e@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I just want everything to stop","1","1","[pt 2/3]","https://bsky.app/profile/lifeiszesty.bsky.social/post/3lenfah7fbc2z"

If possible, I want to hear more about her.

OKAY SO. THIS LITTLE SHITHEAD.

I just wanted a kinky slime character that was like. Chaotic and fun. And boy howdy did I get that. She started out way more... domineering? And kinda more serious? But then over time she became an absolute GOOBER and, as my friends call her, ""a menace.""

Oob isn't part of the 'proper' cast of Starstruck [Star, Comet, Penny, Marble, Cinder, Monty, Joey, Nova are the main ones], but she IS one of the side/background characters like Tuli, Rodney, Powder, Silvy, Milke, etc. Not even I'M sure where she came from canonically, the joke is she was a ""generic enemy slime"" from some RPG world that hitched a ride on an overly-arrogant hero that visited the studio. She slipped into the water supply and fucked around until she learned how to take on a more 'acceptable' form, aka this weird, curvy 'bunny' girl. She paraded around like she was a 'client', Penny wasn't buying it, and called her ass out as an RPG slime. However, since that portal had been long-since closed, and they didn't know where she came from, well.......... She's just kinda. Stuck there. They decided she's 'harmless enough' so she's not a problem that's worth taking care of. PLUS. She has actually been a boon to the studio because she can tell if stuff is dirty or poisoned just by touching it. [she hates germs with a burning passion]

So now this obnoxious, mischievous slime girl lives at the studio. in the walls. in the water supply sometimes. They can't get rid of her.

SO.

    Oob is made of magic slime that causes body alteration when consumed.
    Small, candy sized amounts can cure most aches and pains!
    About an ounce causes psychoactive effects [like head and body highs]
    The slime is breathable! Hence why sometimes she'll shoomp onto someone and become a living bodysuit without hurting them. [Most of the time it's to be a menace, but if she's got a client, well... there's a lot a slime can do when it's covering every inch of your body.]
    She LOVES tormenting/bothering/pranking people. She gets easily bored and can't stop moving.
    If she eats/absorbs someone [non-digestion], she can steal their traits temporarily
    HATES germs. Ignorance is bliss, don't tell her how dirty everything around her is.
    Will feed herself to people by kissing them
    Reforms via her O-shaped necklace
    Can change size- gets smaller the more pieces of herself that she sheds
    When consumed in larger portions than an ounce, she can do anything from control someone's body, alter their shape/make them chubbier in specific areas [wherever she wants] and give them a MAJOR high if she so chooses to. Any weight she makes someone gain can be lost within like five minutes of moderate exercise.
    Over-eager, enthusiastic, hyper, and WAY too into what she does
    Becomes larger when exposed to bodies of water [don't let her in the punch bowl]

last fun fact for the day is when I initially made Oob, it was like driving face-first into oncoming traffic [my friends] because I destroyed everyone with her concept because, and I quote, ""VEE YOU DON'T GO TO THIS SCHOOL, YOU CAN'T DO THIS""","836","644","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreiat5sbd4b5wqbi5qypthl2qtujn5djxnnjr4w7pip24vakdberzje@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreiat5sbd4b5wqbi5qypthl2qtujn5djxnnjr4w7pip24vakdberzje@jpeg","Ref sheet of OP's slime character, Oob","1447","2000","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreidksqstlb3jg4wvwjljgssvr2dqc6yvif4ttq7i2nadm3cezfe2ea@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreidksqstlb3jg4wvwjljgssvr2dqc6yvif4ttq7i2nadm3cezfe2ea@jpeg","Illustration of slime character absorbing another character through her stomach/crotch, grinning like a goblin, her form starting to change to look more like the person she's absorbing.","882","1110","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreic2psewbacuz2hp2bwovmvodugekayakdzmicabrj4edpa4lofifq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreic2psewbacuz2hp2bwovmvodugekayakdzmicabrj4edpa4lofifq@jpeg","en",,,"95",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zp7fsbnfj3k7xqy7ehqyixyh/bafkreicay53ved5yo4d7goi5ra3hu4caej5fr36bgvjyqizyahojsfih3u@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I just want everything to stop","5","16","Oob sounds amazing!

They were in bed together, their touch was on the narrator, leaving a golden tattoo behind, leaving the narrator pining for more
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation. My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)

My client, whom I’ll call Bobby, was an elderly man with a recent traumatic brain injury that had left him disabled and unable to find stable housing. I was working with him to secure a place in assisted housing and was in contact with him on an almost daily basis. At some point, though, for about a week, he vanished—no notice, no clue regarding his whereabouts. He just disappeared.

He had been robbed, and during the robbery his prescription heart medication was taken. The robbers, presumably after discovering it was not a drug with street value, threw his prescription onto the street in front of him. A witness to the attack had called the police, but when they arrived the robbers were long gone. Bobby, however, was still at the scene trying to pick up his medicine from the ground. Bobby was arrested by the officers for possession of prescription medicine outside of a proper container. 

Since the non-profit organization that I worked for couldn’t handle criminal cases, Bobby was assigned a public defender. He sat in jail for a few days before meeting with his lawyer, who explained that if Bobby pled guilty, he would be placed on probation for a year and the charge would be dropped at the end of that time. Bobby, who wanted to leave jail as soon as possible, agreed to this and thou",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:squcwsoa45f5ibxykhzpnvnc/bafkreignvt5rtni6hfrgky2rstcuptpx4l4bs4j3mmolfoffhp3g7hfebm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:squcwsoa45f5ibxykhzpnvnc/bafkreignvt5rtni6hfrgky2rstcuptpx4l4bs4j3mmolfoffhp3g7hfebm@jpeg","As Bobby told me this story, I immediately began to worry about his housing situation. The assisted housing facility would not allow people who were on probation to reside there. After several calls with his public defender, I realized that there was not much that could be done. Bobby, after all, had admitted his guilt in front of a judge and had waived any rights he had to appeal. So he had to wait a year, living in substandard housing, before he would be eligible for the assistance he desperately needed, all because he had made his guilty plea without understanding the full consequences.

His legs were tired, and they were beginning to hurt. Staring at the dull green of the plastic booth surrounding him, he realized he had been crouching in that cramped booth for over 15 minutes. He wondered if anyone had seen him in front of the stall with that awkward posture, and how they must have felt about it. At least the men he was filming didn't seem to notice.
The day before, Anon had noticed a strange little hole that looked like it had been drilled into the stall walls. It had the look of a clean hole, so Anon's guess was that it was the hole for a screw or something. He realized that day that this new hole happened to align perfectly with the urinals. Too perfect, in fact. It was at crotch height and aimed squarely at the dicks of those who used the urinals. Today, Anon decided to take advantage of that. He spent the last few minutes watching the men around the shopping center going about their business from the viewfinder of his phone as it illicitly recorded them.","1970","1387","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreia7ayxibuq3x2tmym63muckeniy54kt3m2qzwhdl7m4kqm2abwwza@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreia7ayxibuq3x2tmym63muckeniy54kt3m2qzwhdl7m4kqm2abwwza@jpeg","Anon was not satisfied. Every dick he saw and filmed was small, barely visible. It was a cold day. The jackets the men were wearing blocked the view. Reviewing all his footage, Anon was frustrated. The door to the restrooms clanked loud, slamming into the wall, startling Anon. Whoever had barged into this restroom let out a large groan. It sounded familiar to Anon. He peeked into the hole and saw his friend, Cano. Before he had a chance to fully recognize him, Anon saw Cano's eyes. He was staring straight at him.
Anon drew back, startled. He wondered for a second if Cano had seen him, but reassured himself that the hole was too small to see anything significant inside. Anon heard the unbuckling of Cano's pants, and looked down at his phone, prepared to record. His mind raced. This whole time, he had been shamelessly recording and intruding on dozens of people's privacy, but this time it was his friend. What would Cano do if he got caught this time? Was Anon really going to risk everything just to see what his friend's dick looked like? The jingling of Cano's belt stopped. Anon's heart began racing. Shaking, he pressed record and held the camera over the hole.
Cano. His long, somewhat unkempt hair. That same tired expression he had seen on his face before. Anon saw his cock. It wasn't erect, but even as a soft dick, Anon could still tell it was big. He could only focus on the large, uncut member of his friend as it began to release a strong stream of urine. His cock began to throb, the sight of his friend's own cock arousing him.","1970","1387","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreibjvhibu6czwt47qduio3s2wbnpe7c22afnlhgxplhmddqz3khohy@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreibjvhibu6czwt47qduio3s2wbnpe7c22afnlhgxplhmddqz3khohy@jpeg","His mind raced, he wanted to open that stall and beg Cano for his cock. Anon's soft, trembling breathing was picked up by his phone's microphone. With one hand still holding the phone, the other struggled to unbutton his pants and reached into his underwear. Anon's cock was rock solid. He reached the tip and immediately got coated with precum. Feeling his hand against his dick head, the ooze of the pre covered his palm as Anon lowered his pants down. The flow of urine from Cano's piece of meat had stopped. Cano shook his floppy dick around, launching droplets of piss all over the urinals. Zipping back up, he disappeared from the sight of the camera.
Anon pulled his phone back and pressed stop. Opening the photo app, he saw it all over again. Anon sat back down and zoomed into Cano's dick. How large it looked. How it expanded as he pissed. The foreskin wrapped around the dick the whole time. Anon was stroking furiously. His hand shook as he reached orgasm, nearly turning the phone's screen into a blurry mess. He struggled to hold his moan as he exploded all over the toilet, splattering his offspring onto the toilet water.
Anon struggled to catch his breath. He was a red-faced, sweaty mess. He put his phone in his pocket, wiped the sweat from his face with toilet paper and lifted up his pants. Exiting the stall, he saw his red face in the mirror's reflection. His plan now was to run out those doors and leave the mall without anyone noticing.","1970","1387","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreidoj7amq2londfswutehztxxn2ig5klh2wui2ohoj6qiy4celnmc4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:lm3ozvstttzelyliri4hoird/bafkreidoj7amq2londfswutehztxxn2ig5klh2wui2ohoj6qiy4celnmc4@jpeg","His plan was quickly thwarted when he opened the door to Cano standing just outside. Cano looked at Anon and gave him the same friendly smile that he had always given to Anon.

""Hey, Anon!"", Cano said
""H-heyyy"", Anon stammered.
""Didn't know you were here too. Wanna join me?""
Anon thought about trying to escape, but he couldn't explain to Cano why he wanted to say no.
""S-sure!""
""Cool,"" Cano said. ""Let's go!""

Anon felt weird. Here he was, walking next to his friend who is smiling at him, mere minutes after secretly filming him taking a piss. He wondered: How would Cano feel if he saw the video?

""Hey Anon"", Cano said.
""Yeah?"", replied Anon.
""I got a question.""
""... what.""
Cano leaned towards Anon's ear. Anon gulped. Cano whispered.

""Did I look good in that video?""

    It's been almost 6 months since they defeated the Elderbrain. Everybody seems to have found a purpose in life. Except Maeva. Should she stay with Halsin and become a 'mummy' to the refugees (something that frankly terrifies her) or leave and find her own adventure? Maybe with her best friend Astarion, down in the Underdark...

'I'm going to miss you.' It was true. And not just as a friend. They'd been good together in battle too, their movements and weapons enhancing each other like a paired set of steel blades. She bit her lip. And they had fucked - as he so eloquently put it - twice, until she'd had a flash of conscience and finished that particular source of enjoyment.
Sometimes she was such an idiot.

'The map is now in my possession.’ Minthara pulls the folded directions out of a pocket and flourishes it at Yousen. 'I have too many memories of never-ending meanders in pointless, repetitive circles while following Maeva.'
Yousen chuckles. Maeva glares at them both.
'You are an outstanding warrior and a formidable negotiator. However, your navigational skills leave a lot to be desired.’ Minthara shudders as if remembering a particularly horrific example. ‘But we cannot all excel in every area.'
Maeva mutters under her breath. 'At least I'm not scared of clowns.’
'I am not scared of clowns. I merely find them an unnecessary burden on the imagination.’ Minthara nods at the servant who has accompanied her for the last few days of her visit. 'Lead on.'

the meaning of life is summed up in the story elmer bendiner tells about how when he was a pilot the second world war, his plane was hit with a barrage of anti-aircraft fire from the nazi forces but the crew survived. and how everyone was saying it was a miracle until they investigated the shells that got in the fuselage and found there was no explosive charges in any of them. in one they found a note scribbled in czech, written by the person who had been forced to manufacture the shells, and it just said “this is all we can do for you now”.

every time i see someone acting tough online about how harm reduction is pointless and in some convoluted way worse than doing nothing i think about that person in some soul-destroying nazi factory in occupied czechoslovakia removing all of the explosive charges from their anti-aircraft shells and writing a note that they must have known would probably never be read, just to say “this is all we can do for you, and we’re going to do it”, they are trying to make us kill you and we refuse. i do think that maybe it's all going to be okay.

I am a lurker of this subreddit and usually don't agree with the stuff posted here but find myself pretty burnt out from the liberal posters and the Democratic Party in general. I don't like Trump and was upset he won the election but have a few thought I wanted to share:
• all the Twitter banning is such pointless virtue signaling it's getting cringey. I don't like Musk but the knitting subreddit banning twitter isn't going to do anything.
• I don't like trump but am not rooting for him to fail. I'm an American and hope for our countries success over which side won or lost. Life isn't defined by what political party is in power and the gamification of politics is making people lose their minds.
• I don't think his first presidency was great but all the news articles and posters saying he's the worst president is laughable. In my lifetime we launched the war on terror which killed thousands of Americans.
The people who don't get out in the world and spend all their time bashing politicians online is making Reddit terrible. Right now that is far and away coming from democrats. We lost. This is ‹ V democracy. If you don't like it then mobilize in meaningful ways to boost the democratic party.

And yet, you think as you press your lips to the cool place between his brows, he looks peaceful. He looks like he's sleeping. You imagine what it might have been like to see that peaceful face in a different context, pressed against a soft pillow on a sunny, slow Sunday morning, and you wish you could have built that life for him — the life he deserved, free from all the suffering he bore.

But now he's gone.

Your students are waiting.

It's time to go.","1119","1656","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a3spef27zk7buvi2opwfqqxc/bafkreif7wialwklvyfql4biqnhhcubsrhkzuan6yf2uvnyblnstkcwwqji@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:a3spef27zk7buvi2opwfqqxc/bafkreif7wialwklvyfql4biqnhhcubsrhkzuan6yf2uvnyblnstkcwwqji@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"16",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a3spef27zk7buvi2opwfqqxc/bafkreifgjc4kfmj7wlfx3ucrmgsnxdorvklxyjwgx7siqfeuth47taohua@jpeg?f=.jpeg","Life is pointless","5","2","when i first saw this piece all the way back in march this year, it moved me to write (in 2nd person POV gasp). i never shared this because it's pure unedited stream of consciousness but sometimes i think ""oh my god he had to kill his one and only"" and it hits like a freight train. take it i guess 😭","https://bsky.app/profile/fushiglow.bsky.social/post/3ld3wq2xess2c"

The second drawing is in a simplified style of Wolfwood kissing Meryl on the top of her head. Wolfwood has his hands laced behind his back and Meryl looks embarrassed as she says, “Undertaker.” In the top right of the canvas, there is a small doodle of Wolfwood’s Punisher gun and Meryl’s Derringer next to each other.

Verse 1)
Down in the heart of Dixie, there's a boy named Brandon,
With eyes as blue as the summer sky, he's my rock, my mountain.
We met down at the diner, where baguettes and croissants are sold,
He ordered me a coffee, said ""You're prettier than gold.""

(Chorus)
Oh Brandon, you're my southern breeze,
You light up my world, put my mind at ease.
But why do you hate me Nancy? It's a mystery,
'Cause you aren't running for the pope, you're just being free.

(Verse 2)
We danced under the stars, on that old country road,
With fireflies as our spotlight, our love story unfolded.
But Nancy from the trailer park, she's got her eyes on you,
She whispers lies and rumors, trying to break us in two.

(Chorus)
Oh Brandon, you're my guiding light,
In this world full of darkness, you make everything right.
But why do you hate me Nancy? It's hard to see,
You aren't running for the pope, you're just being free.

(Bridge)

It was shit. And hilarious.
Imagine a Bourne Identity type film crossed with Central Intelligence, with a bit of Jumanji (I LOVE The Rock - sue me!), and then throw in some dinosaurs! Lots of dinosaurs. But then somehow make it shit.
Anyway the villain looked like Tim Cook, was played in the vein of Peter Isherwell (Don’t Look Up - kinda Zuckerberg via Assange), but I think was meant to be Musk. He had a Hyperloop under his lair, and had put neuro implants into the dinosaurs that he owned - Neurolink anyone?

“Oh great,” I muttered.
“Hey Tally, did we have sex? I don’t remember, so you can’t have been very good!” he said. If looks could kill I swear he’d be dead.

He fed all of them and then we got back into bed. Now this is actually my favourite part. He turned me over, pushed my face into the pillow and started slapping me - first with hands, then with a cane, then another cane, and the IKEA chopping board. That was definitely a first. As apparently I'm able to tolerate less and less pain over the years, I was screaming a lot and trying to escape, which lead him to sit on my legs to keep them from moving. I loved that. He then smiled playfully and asked me how old I was getting. Without suspecting anything, I replied, '32'. He then told me that, to celebrate the occasion properly, he'll give me another present - 32 canings for my 32nd birthday. And, on top of that, I'll have to count every caning, out loud.

Something I really, really like.
He then started hitting me with a cane. It hurt a lot but I managed to breathe and focus on the counting. I was merely suspecting that getting a number wrong would lead to more canings, so I did my best to do it right — one, two, three... thirty two.

was breathing deeply, I couldn't move a single part of my body, and I had zero control over anything, even my mind.

present for me. At that point I felt so spoiled and I loved it. I also loved watching him make me breakfast - naked, sleepy, and, okay I'll admit it, surrounded by cats.
Hot as fuck. He made me coffee, followed by killer vegan blueberry pancakes and orange juice. Yes, you guessed it right - these were my 'post-fisting birthday pancakes, which, I hope, were well deserved. This was without a doubt a great way to start the day... and the new year in my own personal calendar. Note to all the guys out there: make an effort. Trust me, it's hugely appreciated.

However, it felt absolutely incredible and I was definitely stretched out and soaked with my own mess. As a bonus he used the inflatable dildo inside me, which I really loved (I'm still yet to buy one and train myself properly with it).
He then went down on me but before he did, he made me promise not to cum without his permission. Naturally, I said yes, not because I wanted to behave, but because it's incredibly hard for anyone to make me cum, especially during a first date. I can count the men who've ever managed to make me cum on one hand.
So, obviously when I replied with 'I promise, I was actually thinking 'Yeah, good luck with that, I probably won't even get close to an orgasm'. Well, I was fucking
wrong.","2000","1098","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:fqppyrpuh4yhsknwjzffy6ba/bafkreicxj7x624epula6m3yxz6cmjw6mkb3rttrnngvigawbq367uhqwte@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:fqppyrpuh4yhsknwjzffy6ba/bafkreicxj7x624epula6m3yxz6cmjw6mkb3rttrnngvigawbq367uhqwte@jpeg","In my experience, very few men know what they're doing down there. Or even if they do, there's that thing where different things work on different people, and it's often hard to find the right technique with a new partner. In this case, he knew exactly what he was doing, I didn't even have to give him directions. He was sucking my clit and fingering me, rather than just randomly flicking his tongue up and down, which is exactly what I like.
Tongue dancing doesn't work on me - I need someone with a warm, eager set of lips who knows what to do, and is able to keep doing it until I cum.
Which I did. Hard.

Oops. To be fair I would happily handle all the punishments in the world in exchange for a good orgasm. He didn't punish me though. Which was good in this case as I was able to enjoy the whole experience fully.
I took a few seconds to catch my breath and then started sucking his dick. After a while, he turned me over and got inside me. I was trying to be quiet as his flatmate was at home at that point, so I was using the pillow to stop myself from moaning.
He came in a bit so the score became 1:1 - a rare situation in my tiny orgasm book.","1527","1178","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:fqppyrpuh4yhsknwjzffy6ba/bafkreibdmjgnqw35hlv4l3eacjpum6a3tvzed6nbwdft24fqfjh3mopybq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:fqppyrpuh4yhsknwjzffy6ba/bafkreibdmjgnqw35hlv4l3eacjpum6a3tvzed6nbwdft24fqfjh3mopybq@jpeg","Shortly after that, as we were getting ready to sleep, he told me that he got a toothbrush for me in the bathroom. I was a bit shocked at first but not in a 'umm that's creepy' way, more like in a 'why isn't every guy I meet like that?' way instead. I know what you'll think - yes, in theory it's unnecessary but it's a lovely gesture and shows that the other person cares about your comfort... or, you know, about your breath.
We went to bed and he was honestly the best cuddler I've ever had. I fucking love cuddling, which often surprises people. I mean, yes, I love to be slapped around and treated horribly, but I also love a good cuddling session if I feel connected to the other person. He was simply amazing at it
- warm, gentle and incredibly
affectionate. It was obvious that he loves that part as it definitely didn't feel like an obligation on his side.

Half the kids were still in the hallways trying to get a look at Dillon. He loves to be the center of attention, so he was milking it.

Is that when you went to find Crew?

Crew was watching with everyone else. I pushed through the crowd and told him he was a…what I said.

You didn’t touch him? Maybe punch him?

No. He put me in a headlock and pulled me into a classroom.

Why didn’t he just pound you in the hall?

With my superhero boyfriend twenty feet away?

What happened when Crew got you in the classroom?

I'm sure other people told you. The teacher heard the commotion outside. Half the class followed her into the hall. The other kids watched Crew slam my face repeatedly into a k-pop 3-ring binder.

How many times is repeatedly?

How the hell should I know? I was a little distracted. After cutting my face up he knelt on my neck and said he’d break my spine if I didn’t tell him how Dillon had done the zappy thing.

How did you respond?

I was trying to breathe.

Keep talking.

I guess that’s when Dillon came in. I was still out of it but I heard crackling and sparking—like a campfire on triple speed.

He’d known coming into it that he’d be pushed to his limit, but that didn’t even count the god damn finalizing designs to make sure that they had enough new looks for the show.  It meant that he was barely able to text Stede between meetings, instead he was in his sketch book or dictating notes to Izzy.
Perhaps it was knowing that he was ending his day with something other than his hotel room and the gaping feel of exhaustion, but he threw himself into his role.  He knew how to design, he knew how to lean into the darkness and edgy designs that Blackbeard was known for.  They weren’t everyday designs either.  It was all Haute Couture, wild designs that were larger than life, shit that had made Blackbeard famous.  He leaned into it.
Perhaps it was thinking about how long he’d been living a lie, but he dragged out the old designs from when he’d been younger.  They had all been aimed at creating a persona strong enough to warn others away.  They were fueled by anger and fear, a darkness that had been scarred into his skin.  He reworked sketches, added embellishments, created looks that were smoky and intimidating, tying in the theme of the depths of the ocean.  
“You still got it, boss.”  Izzy gave him a tight smile as they left the latest appointment, glancing over at the designs.

“’Course you did, Iz.”  Ed muttered and flopped into the backseat of the car, flicking on his tablet with a frown.  “You always think that.”
“I think we can pull most of this off, but you’re gonna want to review models.”  Izzy slanted a look at Ed. “I can schedule that in tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah, s’fine.”  Ed muttered and tried not to grimace at the amount of black on his designs. “Y’think maybe we can add in some red?”
“What?”  Izzy’s brows shot up to his hairline.  
“Red, some sorta color.”  He pursed his lips and made a few notations on the jacket design, adjusting the cut of the coat to be higher, just beneath the chest.  
“You don’t do color.”  Izzy blinked a few times and narrowed his eyes.  “Ed, don’t mess with what works.”
“Why?  M’fuckin’ Blackbeard, mate, I can do what I want.”  He tapped a finger on the edge of his tablet before looking at the dark design, the shades of black blending together.  “C’mon, be daring, dash of color in all that black.”
“For a new designer?  Yeah.  For you?  It’d get all the wrong reactions.”  Izzy sighed and furrowed his brows. “Ed, ya gotta keep it together.  You wanna get creative? Fuckin’ toss it on another designer, let them take the risk.”

Just pack it in?”
“Blackbeard is a legend, Ed.  Legends don’t get to retire.”  The other omega’s voice was almost sympathetic for the grumpy bastard.  “You’ve pulled back from the public eye, that’s gotta be enough.”
“So what?  I do this until I fuckin’ die?”  Ed slanted an angry look at Izzy.  “Just keep pumping out this shit and then keel over, fuck, even my casket would be black.”
“Don’t get all mopey, twat!”  There was a frustrated sigh.  “You have a damn empire, peoples’ jobs count on you, those fuckin’ designers, omegas you hired, they need Blackbeard.”
“They shouldn’t need an alpha to get ahead.”  Ed muttered, feeling a bitter churn in his belly.  “S’fucked.”
“Yeah, it is, but it’s the world, you can’t change the fuckin’ world, Edward, just survive in it.”  Izzy repeated the old wisdom.  “Right, next up, we’re meeting with Vogue, they want to arrange a photo shoot.  I had Fang bring over that tentacle jacket, but they wanted the original look.”
“’Course they do.”  Ed muttered and flicked his tablet off after sending off the designs.  Just one more meeting and then he’d be able to retreat to hang out with Stede.  He could shed away Blackbeard and just be Ed.

I’ve gone through a rough break up with my ex-fiancée and I’m living alone — truly by myself, no roommates, in a studio apartment — for the first time in my life. I’m generally very depressed at this point, and I decide one night, after a long stretch of sad solo dinners at home, to treat myself to a night at the movies.

Every year during the Academy Awards, when they get to the short film nominees, I tell myself “Those look good, next year I’m gonna watch all those bad boys” and then, of course, the next year comes round and the bad boys remain unwatched. But this year, in an effort to shock myself back into happiness by shaking up my routine, I take action, look up showtimes, find that my favorite walking-distance theater has some, and buy a ticket. As I walk out and head for the theater, for the first time in weeks, I’m feeling pretty okay.

I get there, get high, and head inside to settle in for the slate: all five entries are shown back-to-back in one screening that is roughly the length of a feature film. The first short is a Spanish entry called Madre, directed by Rodrigo Sorogoyen.","1290","1412","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","(Warning: If you had any intention of watching the 2019 Oscar short films — and if you haven’t picked it up by now, I am ultimately going to recommend that you do not — then it is my duty to inform you that plot spoilers lie ahead for all five films, but the details, I’m afraid, are important.)

Madre is mostly one sustained take, wherein a young woman returns home from a shopping trip with her mother in tow, just as she’s receiving a call on her cell phone. On the other end of the call is her 6-year-old son. The boy, on vacation with his father (the woman’s estranged husband), is alone and lost on a beach.

She naturally begins asking her son questions, only some of which he is able to answer with any clarity, but which illuminate the basic details: the boy’s father and some friends took the boy on a planned surfing trip somewhere on the coast of France — or maybe Spain; the boy’s grasp of geography is still weak — but they somehow became separated and now the boy can’t find them.

Oh, also: his cell phone battery is dying.","1282","1436","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","The woman’s mother watches on from the kitchen table in agony, helpless.

The woman tells the boy to hang tight and calls the police. They aren’t much help but they tell her to come down to the station. As she’s leaving to do so, she gets another call. It’s the boy again. His battery is almost dead — but now there’s a stranger on the beach, a man, and he’s noticed the boy.

The boy says he’s scared. She tells him to run. She hears him find a hiding spot behind a rock, but it’s too late. The man spots the boy and starts approaching — when the battery dies. The call ends. The woman screams and rushes out of the apartment, and the camera lands on the horrified face of her mother.

The end.

HOOOOOOOooooooookay.

I take a deep breath. It‘s an incredibly well done piece, but Madre is a fucking fraught tale of child endangerment, expertly directed to crank the tension to maximum levels. In between films one and two, the room is kinda buzzing with energy. I enjoyed it, but I hope quietly that lighter fare is on the way.

It’s all fun and games until one boy is swallowed whole by some sort of quicksand— extremely, excruciatingly slowly — right in front of his buddy.

After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the friend flees for help. He climbs for hours over giant, dune-like heaps of gravel, in a montage reminiscent of an old-Hollywood Arabian epic, until finally being picked up by a passing motorist, a nice older woman.

When she leaves him in the car at a gas station to call for help, he begins to sob when he spots something outside the window: a frolicking fox, disappearing into the tree line.

I first discovered what was killing these men.
I had three sons who worked with their father in the tunnel:
Cecil, aged 23, Owen, aged 21, Shirley, aged 17.
They used to work in a coal mine, not steady work for the mines were not going much of the time.
A power Co. foreman learned that we made home brew, he formed a habit of dropping in evenings to drink, persuading the boys and my husband— give up their jobs and take this other work.
It would pay them better.
Shirley was my youngest son; the boy.
He went into the tunnel.
My heart my mother my heart my mother
My heart my coming into being.
My husband is not able to work.
He has it, according to the doctor.
We have been having a very hard time making a living since this trouble came to us.

He said, ""Mother, I cannot get my breath.""","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","Shirley was sick about three months.
I would carry him from his bed to the table, from his bed to the porch, in my arms.
My heart is mine in the place of hearts, They gave me back my heart, it lies in me.
When they took sick, right at the start, I saw a doctor.
I tried to get Dr. Harless to X-ray the boys.
He was the only man I had any confidence in, the company doctor in the Kopper's mine, but he would not see Shirley.
He did not know where his money was coming from.
I promised him half if he'd work to get compensation, but even then he would not do anything.
I went on the road and begged the X-ray money, the Charleston hospital made the lung pictures, he took the case after the pictures were made.
And two or three doctors said the same thing.

I have gained mastery over my two hands I have gained mastery over the waters I have gained mastery over the river.

They sent the lawyers down and the doctors down; they closed the electric sockets in the camps.
There was Shirley, and Cecil, Jeffrey and Oren, Raymond Johnson, Clev and Oscar Anders, Frank Lynch, Henry Palf, Mr. Pitch, a foreman; a slim fellow who carried steel with my boys, his name was Darnell, I believe. There were many others, the towns of Glen Ferris, Alloy, where the white rock lies, six miles away; Vanetta, Gauley Bridge, Gamoca, Lockwood, the gullies, the whole valley is witness.

Der Beitrag enthält einen Witz über die Netzwerkprotokolle TCP/IP und UDP.

Text im Bild:

Oben steht ein Tweet von “Kirk Bater”:
“This image is a TCP/IP Joke. This tweet is a UDP joke. I don’t care if you get it.”

Darunter folgt ein Screenshot eines Dialog-Threads:
	1.	Iamkirbater:
“Do you want to hear a joke about TCP/IP?”
	2.	Jkjustjoshing:
“Yes, I’d like to hear a joke about TCP/IP.”
	3.	Iamkirbater:
“Are you ready to hear the joke about TCP/IP?”
	4.	Jkjustjoshing:
“I am ready to hear the joke about TCP/IP.”
	5.	Iamkirbater:
“Here is a joke about TCP/IP.”
	6.	Iamkirbater:
“Did you receive the joke about TCP/IP?”
	7.	Jkjustjoshing:
“I have received the joke about TCP/IP.”
	8.	Iamkirbater:
“Excellent. You have received the joke about TCP/IP. Goodbye.”

Beschreibung: Der Witz spielt auf die Eigenschaften von TCP/IP an, einem Protokoll, das eine zuverlässige Kommunikation sicherstellt, indem es die Zustellung von Nachrichten überprüft. Die absichtliche Redundanz und die ständigen Bestätigungen imitieren diese Funktionsweise. Der Kommentar oben kontrastiert dies mit UDP, das Nachrichten ohne Überprüfung versendet.","1559","1164","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:5at4d4mtlnvh45wzk2bxtdqf/bafkreicjmzlyx7a6hq2rwjeyv22oo7ospr7qs5iep3l6ggewrdaflqzsly@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:5at4d4mtlnvh45wzk2bxtdqf/bafkreicjmzlyx7a6hq2rwjeyv22oo7ospr7qs5iep3l6ggewrdaflqzsly@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"de",,,"16",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:5at4d4mtlnvh45wzk2bxtdqf/bafkreicjmzlyx7a6hq2rwjeyv22oo7ospr7qs5iep3l6ggewrdaflqzsly@jpeg?f=.jpeg","want do die","4","1","Als der hardwarenahe Entwickler, der ich bin, sind mir TCP/IP & UDP  Witze einfach zu hoch, sorry.","https://bsky.app/profile/erikmeusel.bsky.social/post/3lbfurtqbx22w"

Oliver North ran an ad in the Wall Street Journal today.

In it, his handlers said, ""The Special Prosecutor is taking Oliver North to Court again...at _your_ expense!""

""Next Wednesday, Lt. Colonel Oliver North, USMC (Ret.) is to appear in court again at the insistence of Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. While tens of millions of taxpayer's dollars have been spent on this fruitless prosecution, Oliver North has had to rely on his friends to bear the financial burden of defending himself. By forcing Ollie to maintain a costly, never ending legal defense, Walsh is punishing him in the only way he can--by trying to inflict as much financial damage as possible.""

""Colonel North needs your financial help to once again face the Special Prosecutor and his unlimited budget. Please make a generous gift today.""

""Call 1-800-933-8565 to make your donation...""

Maybe with her best friend Astarion, down in the Underdark...

'I'm going to miss you.' It was true. And not just as a friend. They'd been good together in battle too, their movements and weapons enhancing each other like a paired set of steel blades. She bit her lip. And they had fucked - as he so eloquently put it - twice, until she'd had a flash of conscience and finished that particular source of enjoyment.

I wish I'd met you after everything had burned,
after the markets crash and global sea levels rise.
The forests scorched. The grasslands trespassed.
My love, it's a whole life's work to disappear -
ask the god with his head in the wolf's mouth or
the serpent intent on swallowing all the earth.
Ask the senate subcommittee for market is solutions of
for late capitalism and early-onset dementia.
You and a bird flu could make me believe in fate.
I think we might be happy in the end, in the dark 
of a hollow tree, a seed bank or blast-proof bunker,
if only you would sing the song I love, you know
the one about our precious eschatology, the one
I always ask to hear to lull me back to sleep.

So, the NEVERMORE teaser has sparked a lot of positivity and some expected negativity. Let me (Van) address the negative first. Some people think it’s disrespectful not to involve Jim or inform him of our plans. But those who feel that way don’t know the history of the band or the behind-the-scenes dynamics that led to this decision. While it may not have been the most ideal approach, the reality is that there hasn’t been communication with Jim in years. 
We felt that sometimes, for the sake of a fresh start, it’s necessary to move on from relationships that may no longer be conducive to growth or new beginnings.  We made this decision with the intention of honoring the legacy of the band while moving forward in a way that felt right for us at the time. That said, we wish him good health and he is free to pursue whatever path he chooses. Without going into too much detail, I’ll just say respect goes both ways, and certain things became irreconcilable over time for us. At this point in my life, I don’t feel the need to explain myself further on this, so take from that what you will.","1721","1343","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreigi72xspykp2u3ipb32xlfebqsdix44od5rywtbur65u546d3ys6e@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreigi72xspykp2u3ipb32xlfebqsdix44od5rywtbur65u546d3ys6e@jpeg","As for why I’m revisiting NEVERMORE, it’s simple, this band has always been my dream. To find a group of guys to be in a band with and travel the world and create music. After auditioning to the moment I was asked to join, it was a whirlwind of music, art, creativity, adventure, fun and camaraderie. Over the years, we made incredible music and amazing memories together. But as time went on, things spiraled out of control..trust, respect, and the joy of it all started to disappear. I always compare it to an analogy like having a cake and eating it too, but in our case, it turned into having a cake covered in shit frosting…You wanna eat it but it’s covered in shit!.. The final breaking point came during the last leg of our European tour with Symphony X, after which it was clear we couldn’t continue as we were. After years of us building the best band we could for ourselves we couldn’t get on the same page to fix it. Jeff and I went one way; Warrel and Jim went another. There was no reconciliation. Warrel went to Brazil, Jim retired to Alaska, and years passed without contact.","1442","1344","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreicl737iz2svokr7bsznfzfg5xcsyzuupwp6piq4xuw34ehcmpmkwa@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreicl737iz2svokr7bsznfzfg5xcsyzuupwp6piq4xuw34ehcmpmkwa@jpeg","During this time, my personal life took a devastating turn when my wife was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. We did everything to create a sense of normalcy for our little boy and we did our best to make her comfortable. Warrel would occasionally call from Brazil, and while we exchanged kind words during those calls, it didn’t erase the past and I can tell that certain things haven’t changed. Dore passed on in 2020, and her loss crushed me and my boy, we feel that loss still to this day. I personally feel like I am just starting to come out of a coma truth be told and thank God I’m finally seeing the light and grateful for who and what I still have in my life. I’ll never be able to express the gratitude I feel for my family, close friends, and fans who helped me and my family through all the dark days. Thank you all so very much for helping me get through the toughest times.

Through it all, Jeff remained one of my strongest supporters, and our bond deepened. Over time, we both missed the joy of creating and performing together. NEVERMORE was a huge part of that joy, something I’m tremendously proud of. 

For those calling this a “money grab,” I have to disagree. Most musicians, don’t do this for the money. We’ve spent countless hours thru the years sweating, rehearsing, performing, and recording simply because we love it. This is what we chose to do in life because we’ve always loved it. That’s what drives us, the passion for music, the connection with fans, and the creative process. If money comes from that, great but it has never been the focus, but we also have bills to pay like you. ","2000","1227","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreiftbnhmoog5mtooe2273zg55qh3aktjlydsyfr7weavhffyhgu66y@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:a4q35d32l6kfxwhsxi35fp5b/bafkreiftbnhmoog5mtooe2273zg55qh3aktjlydsyfr7weavhffyhgu66y@jpeg","So here we are, Jeff and I want to honor NEVERMORE’s legacy by finding musicians who can respect what Warrel and Jim brought to the band while helping us build a new chapter. And this isn’t about replacing Warrel, no one can. But it’s about finding someone who can honor his work while contributing something new. We want to give fans a chance to come together, celebrate the music, and sing those incredible lyrics again. And, hopefully, we can create new music that stands alongside the classics.

I wish the situation with Jim were different, but the past has brought us here. I am personally focusing on positivity and positive people and will refuse to get tangled in the negativity of the past. If Jeff and I can find the right vocalist and bassist—musicians who respect the legacy and want to move forward with us—then this new chapter can be something truly special for all who choose to come along with us. This isn’t going to be a cover band, or a tribute band, it’s going to be the next evolution/chapter of a band determined to pick up the flag and carry on this thing we call NEVERMORE. 
I look forward to seeing you all again.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.

The first is me wearing a flyers hat and a green flannel with a pride flag painted on my face. Above me is a speech bubble that says: ""I love Nona, but I’m not sure if I LOVED Nona the Ninth. It has this real video game feel where our characters grew so powerful, maybe too powerful that we needed to start at level 0 again. I’m curious to see how this affects the over all plot.""

Then there is the book cover for Nona the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir of the Locked Tomb series. We see Nona with braids as she stands with a t-shirt on. The background is a mix of skeletons walking, a many legged dog, and planets. Nothing quite makes sense.

Then there is Eddie Spaghetti a little black cat lying on his back with his paws up with a speech bubble that says: ""Read this if you love:

The last time his body actually feels like it’s his is when he meets Ansem in the first place.

He’s still growing when his body gets stolen by Ansem and changes shape the first time,  and he never forgets how it feels.  It makes him so sick that he swears he’ll never let it happen again.

But what’s he to do when the only way for him to help Sora is to take on the façade of Ansem again for a year,  missing his growth spurt and coming back to a body that grew up without him?  Or what about when he goes into Sora’s dreams and is back to having the first body again,  crammed into it like long outgrown clothes?  The things he will do for love.  He keeps overshooting his acrobatics.  He has scars and birthmarks in the same places but the Dream Eater mark is still on his back.

It’s been years since all this started.  But it still doesn’t quite feel like his body anymore,  no matter how much he spars or works out to try and break it in.  It takes him a minute to recognize himself in the mirror.  He cut his hair to try and stop seeing Ansem in his reflection,  but it did nothing to help him identify himself.  This body doesn’t belong to him,  but the old ones also no longer fit.

He’s always a little too aware of himself.  He’s too muscular,  he’s lost too much weight,  his arms are too long and his hands too big,  he swears his eyes used to be this piercing cyan but now they’re the same color as the ocean.  It’s a surprise if he pinches his arm and it stings.  Sometimes he falls out of sync with himself in a fight and slips up and has to find something to blame it on besides the fact that he feels like he’s puppeting his own body.  Less real to him than a replica body would be.  Like a ghost possessing itself.

(He knows what it feels like to be possessed.  There are moments when it feels like his skin is crawling,  like there’s something underneath that won’t ever leave.)","1748","1079","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cjzgehxn64wcc7rkdqmqxx2b/bafkreifgusfxr3sspfjof7k4bj4eeg53i4sd5yvmasmpbx4u6hfaesvi3a@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cjzgehxn64wcc7rkdqmqxx2b/bafkreifgusfxr3sspfjof7k4bj4eeg53i4sd5yvmasmpbx4u6hfaesvi3a@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"16",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cjzgehxn64wcc7rkdqmqxx2b/bafkreig2y5hnqemhwgmoh75j7ynhzbqqqbmc33fjt2piq6t2jidzl74oam@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I feel nothing","2","5","A little headcanon I wrote for a now defunct RP server about Riku’s relationship with his body.

Thank you for your letter and for your enclosures. I have given some thought to our recent correspondence. It is always difficult to decide on how to respond to people whose ethos is so alien and, in fact, repellent to one's own. Ilt is not that I take exception to the general points made by you but that every ounce of my energy has been devoted to an active opposition to cruel bigotry, compulsive violence, and the sadistic persecution which has characterised the philosophy and practice of fascism. 
1 feel obliged to say that the emotional universes we inhabit are so distinct, and in deepest ways opposed, that nothing fruitful or sincere could ever emerge from association between us. 
should like you to understand the intensity of this conviction on my part. It is not out of any attempt to be rude that I say this but because of all that I value in human experience and human achievement. 
Yours sincerely, 
Bertrand Russell

Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.

“Are you feeling all right?” I asked her.

“I feel all sleepy,” she said.

In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.

The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.

On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunized against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.","2000","1427","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:xhmwhdq4pj2wh5jeucxjhay2/bafkreihawydxtulhyaad3y2cnysoumdfuqlucdckrqrux2elzzknochf6m@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:xhmwhdq4pj2wh5jeucxjhay2/bafkreihawydxtulhyaad3y2cnysoumdfuqlucdckrqrux2elzzknochf6m@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"27000",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:xhmwhdq4pj2wh5jeucxjhay2/bafkreihawydxtulhyaad3y2cnysoumdfuqlucdckrqrux2elzzknochf6m@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I feel nothing","414","11920","The measles outbreak in Texas is reminding me of the public letter Roald Dahl wrote about losing his daughter to measles in 1962, just before the vaccine was publicly available.","https://bsky.app/profile/lethalityjane.bsky.social/post/3liabnxskos2t"

“This is the room of the wolfmother wallpaper. The toadstool motel you once thought a mere folk tale, a corny, obsolete, rural invention.
This is the room where your wisest ancestor was born, be you Christian, Arab, or Jew. The linoleum underfoot is sacred linoleum. Please remove your shoes. Quite recently, the linoleum here was restored to its original luster with the aid of a wax made from hornet fat. It scuffs easily. So never mind if there are holes in your socks.

What room is this? This is the room where the antler carved the pumpkin. This is the room where the gutter pipes drank the moonlight. This is the room where moss gradually silenced the treasure, rubies being the last to go. Transmissions from insect antennae were monitored in this room. It's amazing how often their broadcasts referred to the stars.

To live lightly on the earth, lovers and families must be more flexible and relaxed. The ritual of sex releases its magic inside or outside the marital bond.

I'm surprised someone with your reputation is satisfied lazing around here.”
Zoro forces himself to stay put, looking down at Sanji and keeping his expression flat. “It's just a thing people call me. I'm not actually some killing machine.”
Sanji scratches the hair at the base of his chin, the thin goatee that lines his jaw and that Zoro thinks is also pretty cute. He wants to lick it and feel the texture under his tongue.
“I guess you aren't,” Sanji acknowledges. “Less of a 'kraken' and more like an…annoying squid.”
Zoro bristles. “I'm not a fucking squid.”
Sanji raises an eyebrow and his eyes drop pointedly to Zoro’s tentacles, but he says nothing. 
It’s mean. It’s annoying. Like a lot of the way Sanji has been. But it pushes on something in Zoro, this dismissal of his reputation, that Sanji has wandered up to him, tipping his chin back like he doesn’t give a fuck about the fact that Zoro has killed so many people. Sanji wasn’t afraid after what happened the other night and he’s not afraid now.

one night, i found these three moments conjoined in a dream; in a landscape along a cliff face, standing on its edge as the wind howled before me. my arms outstretched, i leaned forward not to plummet, but to ascend. how quickly i soared above the churning waters, through the gray tufts of uncertain weathers, to reach a place where light was sound all surround. i was unburdened of my woes which agonised my every waking step, knowing only peace and deliverance from my earthly, social, human worries","1613","1440","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:a4ek5b2tsy6at5kfogildrlj/bafkreiehfuwa5wm44w2iemyl524koa7bcwknow73pkr2ukvevkvkgizy64@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:a4ek5b2tsy6at5kfogildrlj/bafkreiehfuwa5wm44w2iemyl524koa7bcwknow73pkr2ukvevkvkgizy64@jpeg","as reality cut the wind from my sails and brought me back to our collective existing space, the seeds were sown for the next part of the story to follow the post-apocalyptic journey of loss, recovery and hope that my prior album ""all that remained was the beating of our hearts"" told. i began work in february after some time away from my daw. as this year carried onward, the world became suffocated with conflict. many friends and inspirations were left adrift from jobs cut by careless suits. the very platform i owe my career to began to crumble at its foundation. i left my home of the past 20 years, moving to a place i still do not really recognise, and gave final words of love to my beautiful cat of 13 years who succumbed to an aggressive cancer that took him away from the life we lived inseparably before he could even be treated

That takes him a second to click. “Oh. Tree Change?” Fuck, he’s been so focussed on Stede that he’d forgotten they were this fucking close to the new season. Tomorrow, holy shit.

“Mm.” Stede nudges Ed’s nose with his, and in the dim light, Ed can see his eyes have drooped shut. “I care so much about all of them. We’ve waited so long. What if it’s… what if it’s not as good as before? What if they do something so terrible that it can’t be taken back? What if people hate it?”

“Can’t please all the people, all the time,” Ed says. “And hey, nothing’s perfect. Nobody’s perfect, not even Aiyana.” They’ve all put a shit ton of their mental wellbeing in one Hollywood show runner, that’s for sure, and she’s carried it incredibly for two seasons, but nothing’s guaranteed. “What we’ve seen in the trailer looks good, yeah? That’s a good start. We’ll always have the first two seasons. And for anything else, this show gave us each other. Our own crew. We’ll have each other if we need emotional backup.”","680","669","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:4oaa67pzwlg3kwcgzveqxflt/bafkreic6pjb2ckqwqi3cu4whfnutqg4flwfbc3jgxdws5pdctwnnfylemm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:4oaa67pzwlg3kwcgzveqxflt/bafkreic6pjb2ckqwqi3cu4whfnutqg4flwfbc3jgxdws5pdctwnnfylemm@jpeg","Stede heaves a sigh. “I just… the conversation about it makes it feel like we’re all watching a different show sometimes.”

Keith has seriously committed fans and seriously committed enemies, and nothing gets the fandom going like these conversations. “We kind of are, though, aren’t we?”

Stede lifts a brow. “Are we?”

Ed settles back into his seat, hooks an ankle over the opposite thigh. “Everyone brings their own experience to watching it. So everyone takes different things away.”

“But the source material, the writers’ intentions—“

“Don’t always match up to the interpretations, yeah.” Still, that’s kind of how it goes. Doesn’t mean people are right about it; doesn’t mean they’re wrong, either. Not to feel the way they do, at least; you can’t always choose your feelings, just… what you do with them.

It’s been snowballing for years, and next episode it’s all going to be there. All of it, everything they’ve put into motion, all their mistakes looking back at them.”

“All their triumphs, too, though.” Ed stares at him. “You saying you don’t want the last episode?”

“Maybe I don’t!” Stede’s eyes gleam a little in the dark. “Would that be insane? If I never watched it, it could be perfect forever.”

It’s a little bit insane, yeah. “Nothing’s perfect, not even Tree Change.”

We could just… assume the happily ever after instead. Make it make sense in our heads, forever and ever. Spin out a thousand possible scenarios, never have to choose a favourite.”

“Does sound pretty good when you put it like that.” Ed pauses. “You really want that?”

“No!” Stede sighs. “No, and I don’t want it for this, either. For us. I want to see the bad guys get what they deserve. I want to see them get their actual happily ever after. I just want it to be exactly what I want, is that so much to ask?”

Same for millions of fans out there, all of them hoping, most for the same things, some not so much.

The Daily Telegraph28 Feb 2025By Tim Sigsworth
NHS nurses have won a legal battle to name a transgender colleague who used their female changing room.

Rose Henderson can be named for the first time after a judge threw out an application for anonymity from the nurse.

Sharon Langridge, an employment judge, ruled last week that there was no evidence for claims that reporting the full name would cause harm.

The nurse, who was born male, lives as a woman but does not have a gender recognition certificate (GRC) and therefore remains a man under the law, a previous hearing was told.

Eight nurses at Darlington Memorial Hospital are suing the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, their employer, for sexual discrimination and sexual harassment after Henderson was allowed to use a female changing room.

At a preliminary hearing last month, Simon Cheetham KC, representing the trust, applied for an order to be made that would prevent the reporting of Henderson’s surname because of the “potential risk” of harm.

In a witness statement, Henderson said “horrible” comments made online made “me scared for my own safety”.

The statement also cited media coverage about the case, which it was claimed had been “amplified by extremely high-profile individuals” such as JK Rowling.","654","761","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cyefpiziml7b24sxpd74axq7/bafkreif75tnf6oo26lmubwfpp2ocdcex24z2botur5s4vwro2xurmpd3bq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cyefpiziml7b24sxpd74axq7/bafkreif75tnf6oo26lmubwfpp2ocdcex24z2botur5s4vwro2xurmpd3bq@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"487",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cyefpiziml7b24sxpd74axq7/bafkreif75tnf6oo26lmubwfpp2ocdcex24z2botur5s4vwro2xurmpd3bq@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I give up","8","99","I think that the GC movement has clearly decided that if they can't get the Equality Act changed to ban trans women from public, that a good strategy is picking individual women and destroying them in the press, hoping that it will cause such a culture of fear that others will give up on... living?","https://bsky.app/profile/katymontgomerie.com/post/3lja6qaybws2z"

L wears a dark green shirt and gray pants. The comic is autobiographical, as L shares with us moments in her past and present, as they relate to her asexuality. It's drawn in purples and hues reminiscent of the Ace flag.

Page 1
Opens with a text conversation between L and somebody else on her Instagram. This mysterious Stranger, sends out a message, in the form of a comment on an Instagram image L posted that shows them celebrating 'Happy Ace Week'.
'Hey!! I think I might be Ace… Is it OK if I ask you about your experience blushing-face-emoji and eyes emoji'
El replies 'Of course!! Being ace is so cool and you’re not alone, hearts emoji'

In the next panel, the camera is focused on L as she looks at her phone
'If I’m honest, I don’t recall the moment I realized I was Ace.'

We cut into the past as we see a younger L scrolling through Tumblr in front of them is a page with the title 'Asexuality! It’s a thing! But it’s 2016 so no one knows much about it.'
El continues explaining through her narration.
L narration - 'I probably stumbled on the term while on Tumblr, feeling seen by the definition at 16.'

This younger L is in bed now with a mildly thoughtful and worried look on their face.
L narration - 'And became an integral part of me, helping me navigate a slurry of feelings I couldn’t quite place.'
'It can be especially difficult as we are fed this idea of a cookie-cutter life growing up.'
We see depictions of the cookie-cutter, life, a video of an assumedly cis and heterosexual couple kissing, a photo of a nuclear family, and next to it some basic sexy romance novels.
'There’s a lack of stories and perspectives that could help people understand the complexity and beauty of it.'

'That’s not normal…'
Says a voice from offscreen. L raises her finger to try to protest
 
'I wish I was Ace, I’m always so horny, it’s so annoying !' says another.
L holds her hand up in mild frustration.

'Do you masturbate?' 
A disgruntled-looking L just stares back.

'Procreating is the purpose of humans'
El holds up the word 'NOPE', in reply.

'Are you capable of love at all?'
El just stares back in shock.

A title sits on top of the last few panels taped on with tape!
Asexuality: experiencing little to no sexual attraction.


Having established the asexual, hailstorm of questions and misconceptions, we return to modern-day, L. She's sitting in an abstract, cloudy display.
L - 'Part of me is always fighting a gentle loneliness,  a fear of solitude in this world where romantic and sexual relationships are prioritized.'

L is now depicted holding a swinging sword, DnD style, now dressed for the fight!
L - 'But, I can’t let myself feed those thoughts!'

","2000","1166","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:omrk7574omkidtfsspobq35w/bafkreibl7fzjldda66xtgufdbggqn2wk3gw73aqd4kefptzlvh65aiopye@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:omrk7574omkidtfsspobq35w/bafkreibl7fzjldda66xtgufdbggqn2wk3gw73aqd4kefptzlvh65aiopye@jpeg","Some floating narration starts this page, still in the cloudy abstract.
L narration -  'My existence is different from many, but that’s the beauty of life! Being asexual doesn’t mean being alone forever. That’s a common misconception!'

L is surrounded by her friends, a whole multitude of people, all happily, hugging, embracing
L narration -  'I have my friends...'

Now we see a bundle of people holding cups, their hands all engaged in conversation
L narration -  'My family...'

L boops her face against her dog who looks lovingly back.
L narration - 'My dog. [she’s also my therapist]'

The floating narration returns.
L narration - 'There is so much love to give and receive and feel. The label of Asexuality is something that helped me understand, in larger strokes, how I approach the world around me.'

L - 'It makes me feel seen and gives me a community!'

L narration -  'I’ve also found peace and self-acceptance through creating art that brings people to me validating the lot of us!'
We now see L in front of her tablet, as she scribbles away, stars and light emanate from the screen in front of her.
L - 'Making characters that represent me.'

This next panel is filled with depictions of her drawn DND characters. A little Teifling is mostly on display.
L - 'Characters that portray asexuality the way, I experience it.'

We're now shown a panel FILLED to the brim with reactions to said illustrations of this art. I wish I could cover it all, but there are simply hundreds of kind loving emoji field reactions. It's lovely. 

The camera pans back to L who looks on with a modicum of surprise as she blushes at the reactions.

We finish the page with L  in bed, holding the phone tight to her chest as an ace heart floats above her.

Moe is depicted hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling, but he appears to be casually waiting rather than distressed. The caption at the bottom reads:

This dark humor moment is in line with Moe's recurring characterization in the show, where he is often portrayed as lonely and depressed, sometimes making jokes about suicidal thoughts.

I saw him cry when Bush/Powell lied about WMD in Iraq.

He was painfully aware it was getting dark, far later than he’d expected to get out of the latest fucking appearance he’d had to put on as Blackbeard. Exhaustion made it hard to act normal, his temper frayed a little as he turned a corner. Tomorrow was the big show for Blackbeard, invites had been sent, everything set up and Ed felt as though he were on his last nerve.
The past few days had been a blur of two pieces of himself. His time spent donning the role of Blackbeard, the same shit, the same conversations, the same god damn exhausting parties. The rest spent as Ed, just Ed, with Stede and his little crew, racing between roles and covering it up. 
Hannah Montana needs new writers, this is fuckin’ exhausting. He thought wearily and rubbed his face, glancing at a window to be sure the black eye paint was gone. 
Ed knew he was playing a dangerous game. There was no denying it. He knew logically that he couldn’t date Stede. For one, fuck, he was a wreck, he knew that. He was a ball of god damn problems that had all been wrapped up in a neat little package named “Edward Teach: Do Not Approach.” It was a sign that Stede should have listened to, but the alpha didn’t see it, the alpha only saw Ed. Somehow, he just saw fucking Edward. He smiled at Ed, beamed and laughed with Ed, ran through the streets hand in hand with Edward Mother Fucking Teach. And Ed couldn’t push him away.

It was a slap in the face, the backwards thinking found in France, and so many other countries. It had been a coup to take the Swede from Low, but also he knew the fucker well enough to know he was dangerous. He knew the claiming laws on the books in France, he wasn’t above using a bit of threat and blackmail to keep the Swede under his thumb. No, Lars was better with the Queen Anne, all of them were. Well, hopefully better, the omega seemed a little off his rocker.
I should end it with Stede, right? I can’t date him. Fuck, what do I say? He felt a twist in his gut. He wouldn’t betray me if he knew, right? He’s not that way.
And then what? He couldn’t exactly date the alpha that publicly, he’d still have to be Blackbeard. He’d still have to perform like a fucking circus monkey for the crowds. They could have a relationship that was mostly built on lies and secrets, even if Stede knew. And, fuck, Ed could hide his scent, but Stede was an alpha, which was harder to hide day to day. What would people say if they picked up the whiff of another alpha on Blackbeard? Omega scents could be covered or excused, they were light and soft, Stede’s scent was meant to be picked up.
Deservedly so. Ed thought wistfully, unable to keep a small smile from himself as he thought about the rich spiced brandy and marmalade.

He hadn’t had much of a taste since the alpha preferred to wear scent patches, but still, he wouldn’t mind waking up with that scent mixed in his nest. 
Ed paused and blinked. The fuck did that thought come from? He didn’t take people to his nest. He gave himself a shake as he walked into the design room, trying to get his exhaustion fogged mind to wake up. His eyes instantly went to where Stede should have been, but the spot was empty except for his assistant. The model was being adjusted as the young alpha adjusted the outfit and took a few pictures.
“Stede around?” Ed glanced about, grinning to see the Swede already in a corner as if he’d always been there. God, Low was gonna be pissed and Ed was gonna enjoy every fucking minute.
“He’s on a call with his ex-wife.” Lucius glanced up and narrowed his eyes before crinkling his nose. “God, did you fall on an alpha or something?”
“Ugh, is it that bad?” Ed sniffed himself. He had worn the faux-alpha scent so long he sometimes didn’t pay attention to it. “Been workin’ all day.”
“Uh, yeah, bad like you rolled all over him.” Lucius straightened up and gave the model a little pat. “Go ahead and take this off, we’ll get it taken in a smidge.”

He could only imagine the omega in there trying to find a way to leave politely without hurting Stede’s feelings.   Stede should have growled and told him he was sexy, gotten possessive and dominating, right?  That’s what alphas were supposed to do with an omega, show them they were desired, not throw them in a changing room with a skirt, then basically confess to crossdressing.  God, he should have put Mary on speed-dial, he should have some sort of person on a mic in his ear to stop making these stupid choices.
“Ed?” Stede called softly and tried to sound like he wasn’t falling into a pit of panic.  “Did you look?”
Of course he didn’t, you idiot, he obviously didn’t want to and you went and made it weird.  He told himself bitterly as there was movement on the other side of the door.
He nearly fell into the changing room as the door swung inwards and Stede only caught himself at the last minute.

“Alpha.” Ed’s voice was a low purr and Stede felt that tone go straight to his cock.
Not a gentleman, I am not a gentleman… He thought before one of Ed’s hands reached out to catch his tie and twisted his fist around it.
“You look… Ed, you’re gorgeous in that, st-stunning… and… oh god… “  Stede gasped as the tie was used like a leash, dragging him into the room and Ed’s hand reached up to slide into his short hair.

“You liked—rrrmmm…”  Stede’s words were lost as Ed’s lips claimed his in a searing kiss.
Stede tipped his head up into the kiss, his hands reached out to press to either side of the soft skirt, sliding upwards as Ed’s tongue darted out.

The world was an explosion of scent, sweet pineapple and coconut, exotic and making Stede’s breath deepen as he moved a hand to wrap around Ed’s waist.  He felt the warm solid weight, the arch into his touch.
He forgot they were in public as Ed’s kiss deepened and their tongues chased each other.  He shifted his weight while Ed slotted himself forward, every inch pressed against Stede until he felt the sweep of the skirt dragging along his pants legs.  He forgot about being a gentleman as Ed’s leg slotted forward, pressing between his thighs as if the omega were bound and determined to get as close as possible.
It was only a need to breathe that eventually made him gasp out, a ragged burst of air as Ed pulled back.  His whiskey brown eyes were dark, intense, hovering so close to Stede’s as their lips barely ghosted one another.  Stede knew his scent had gone sharper, spiced with cinnamon, he couldn’t stop it as he felt the slide of a long-fingered hand gliding along his side, through his hair.

He knew how to fucking get dressed for events like that.  He had an entire wardrobe for that shit packed up in his hotel room.  What he wasn’t used to was going out with a group of people casually to a bar he’d gone to ten years ago and remembered as being fun, relaxed.  What he wasn’t used to was the casual fucking assumption that he was invited and welcome.
He began with some of the low-level Blackbeard shit, but it was just dragging on another costume.  He didn’t want to be Blackbeard, he wanted to be Ed.  Ed and Stede.  A nice ring to it, really, so he dragged out outfits wildly, sorting through in an attempt to figure out what would go well at the club.  He’d picked it out after Stede had confessed that he didn’t want to go to any of the more popular alpha-clubs.  Locations that were mostly used for hook-ups, dominance games, and places omegas and betas went for a bit of fun.  Paris was ripe with them, it normally was, but the Sapphire Moon was low-key, artsy.
You’re a fuckin’ world famous designer, you can make up a god damn outfit.  He told himself in frustration as he ended up with clothes all over his suite.
In the end, he went for something that was a bit of a mix.  The soft turtleneck was black, but the fabric was decadently fine and it was a joy to wear against his skin.

It was Blackbeard’s signature colors, but that was to be expected if he was going to show up and tell them he was…
Fuck, I guess Blackbeard’s PA?  Somethin’ fuckin’ vague.  He thought before dragging on well worn leather pants to match the top.
They were old, worn to fit him like a second skin, wonderfully comforting and he even found a thigh harness to wrap around one upper leg and attach to a wide belt.  It worked perfectly, made him look a little edgy, but hopefully far away from the extravagant fucking leather coat and studs that Blackbeard wore.  No eye makeup, but he paired it with a long trail of earrings and a silver choker around his throat.  Once his long hair was pulled up into a bun to mask the length, Ed looked at himself in the mirror and smirked.  
You’re not dressing to impress Stede, you’re just going out for drinks.  With a group.  Odd, that the group part thrilled him too.  Fuck, you’re a sad sack, excited for drinks with strangers.

It sort of goes along with the old adage, ""Don't cry over spilled milk."" The thing is done, you can't go back and undo it, so you had better figure out how you're going to clean up the mess. And if someone else made the mess, there's no sense in blaming them until AFTER the cleanup is done. It's important, of course, to figure all that out, and hold whoever made the mess to whatever degree of responsibility is appropriate, but trying to do so while there's still a mess on the floor doesn't get you any further towards your immediate goal - which is to clean up the mess.","1200","1600","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","Grasshopper speeding over a bump, moments before the servo broke.

And you will sometimes, in the course of cleaning up messes, make mistakes. You will also encounter opposition from others who complain that you're not cleaning it up the right way, or quickly enough, or whatever. It's important to realize that such comments are useless. The way to fix things is not to sit around discussing the perfect plan of action and figure out exactly how to return everything to its precise pre-mess state; you have to work quickly to stop the mess from spreading, then clean up the bulk of it, and then you can get into the minutiae. And guess what? If your first cleaning method doesn't work, or makes a bigger mess, you can just try something else.","1200","1600","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreigotfxypesudnuqsuwsgm5nvelcyc5fqtwc3blkww7jjf3nt6awde@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreigotfxypesudnuqsuwsgm5nvelcyc5fqtwc3blkww7jjf3nt6awde@jpeg","en",,,"7",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreigmg57lzvdqyx6runtrtt4osstq5hsywjnek3345ibb5koufuwnwq@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","0","1","Spent some time with the spare-parts Tamiya Grasshopper yesterday.

He ignored the sign like his life depended on it as he came in early in the evening while the other designers were still around.  There was gossip and speculation on what had happened while Stede kept his head down and worked on his sketches.  He tried not to feel his cheeks heat up in embarrassment as he heard about Israel Hands having a fit when he’d seen it. He was glad he’d missed it, especially since his first interview with the short, angry man had been less than stellar.
“Soooooo, new friend?”  Lucius probed slyly while he sat on the floor measuring a bit of fabric. “Please tell me you’re not making friends with the janitors, I can’t deal with you hiding out in a cleaning closet again.”
“Lucius!”  Stede snapped and felt the heat rush to his cheeks. “That was only once, and… you know why.”
“Still doesn’t negate the fact I had to break through a closet door to get you out.”  The other alpha lifted the fabric up with a frown before making a few marks.
It had been one the last days at Bonnet Media, when things had been…well, rough was beyond an understatement.  It had been just after his announcement of his divorce from Mary when his father had begun to make his life hell, which included hiring Chauncy Badminton to oversee his department.

Not that he regretted it.
Lucius tried to get more information out of him.  The young alpha didn’t respect most personal boundaries, but for the first time Stede didn’t cave to it.  He didn’t want to talk about Ed, not with anyone, it felt oddly special and private.  It wasn’t something he wanted to have Lucius speculate about, he just wanted to enjoy the fact he’d made a friend.
Which makes me sound like a sad sack.  He thought ruefully as he began to adjust how he had designed the vest.
Stede had spent most of his life struggling to connect with people.  At best, he felt as though he was loosely tolerated, perhaps even affectionately, but there was always the feeling that he had to work for it.  Nearly every connection he had ever made had been a battle.  With Ed, it had been easy.  Almost alarmingly easy.  The omega had grinned at him and giggled, laughing at his jokes about fishing nets and fabric battles.
“I made a friend, can we just leave it at that?”  Stede sighed after the fifth round of interrogation.  “I can have friends.”
“Yeah, you can, but I also know that this industry is cutthroat and I don’t want you to end up getting in trouble.”  Lucius pointed out and set his work aside. 
“It’s not another designer, well, not really?  He works for Blackbeard.”  Stede shrugged it off.

“He was working on an outfit, for Blackbeard I mean, one of his designs.”  Stede said thoughtfully, recalling the leather and jet beads.  
“And, c’mon, Stede, you can’t just leave me hanging when you practically beg to hear the details of my social life.”
“I’ve begged you to stop sending me text updates about your ‘social life’, you mean.”  Stede growled affectionately and gave his head a shake.
Ed had said they’d meet again tonight, would they?  Stede nervously began to erase some lines and add others while Lucius tried to wheedle more out of him.  He wasn’t going to cave, not this time.  He didn’t want to gossip, he just wanted to enjoy an evening where he hadn’t felt wrong-footed around someone.  Where he’d laughed so hard that his cheeks had begun to hurt near the end and he’d gone to sleep with a smile.
If he told Lucius he’d spent the evening with an omega that had been dressed in a pair of pajama pants and a banyan, he was sure things would get crossed.  Not that Ed wasn’t… Stede swallowed and knew that his cheeks were heating as he thought about the elegant, tattooed omega.  The sweet scent of pineapple and coconut that had made Stede want to croon.  Fine, alright, Ed was lovely, breath-taking, but it wasn’t his secondary gender that made Stede enjoy his company.

The banter and laughter, flinging fabric around like snowballs, it had been a lovely interlude.
“Oh shit, there he is.”  Lucius hissed out and Stede’s eyes snapped up.  He was so lost in his thoughts that he immediately looked for Ed.
Instead, he saw the imposing leather-clad Blackbeard striding down the hall with the short, rather irritating, Izzy Hands dogging his heels.  He was unmistakable with a thick beard that hung down to his chest and his heavy hair loose around his head like a lion’s mane.  The black-on-black leather had points of steel that caught the light as he swept past the rooms that went a bit quiet in his wake.
Stede had only seen him a handful of times, each time there was the same reaction, people seemed to stare at him.  He rarely glanced at him, he moved like a ship at full sail, cutting through the waves and leaving behind the burning scent of gun powder and sea salt.  An alpha’s alpha through and through.
“Oh, it’s just Blackbeard.”  Stede sighed and that earned a look from Lucius.
“Okay, no, you’re telling me literally everything about whoever you met last night.”  Lucius demanded sharply as Stede went back to his work rather than stare at Blackbeard.  The man was their employer, not some zoo exhibit, it was impolite to gawk.

""I have known Elon Musk at a deep level for 14 years, well before he was a household name. We used to text frequently. He would come to my birthday party and invite me to his parties. He would tell me everything about his women problems. As sons of highly accomplished men who married venuses, were violent and lost their fortunes, and who were bullied in high school, we had a number of things in common most people cannot relate to. We would hang out together late in Los Angeles. He would visit my San Diego lab. He invested in my company. 

Elon is not a Nazi, per se. 

He is something much better, or much worse, depending on how you look at it. 

Nazis believed that an entire race was above everyone else.""","1509","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreiclz37g2xtjqmqkgpkr2wupcdny2qsqh4cwpolznit56cirezrojq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreiclz37g2xtjqmqkgpkr2wupcdny2qsqh4cwpolznit56cirezrojq@jpeg","Screenshot of Part 2/8 of Philip Low, former Elon Musk Friend, post on Elon Musk.

""Elon believes he is above everyone else. He used to think he worked on the most important problems. When I met him, he did not presume to be a technical person — he would be the first to say that he lacked the expertise to understand certain data. That happened later. Now, he acts as if he has all the solutions. 

All his talk about getting to Mars to “maintain the light of consciousness” or about “free speech absolutism” is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far right parties, because they are easier to control. That is also why he gave himself $56 Billion which could have gone to the people actually doing the work and innovations he is taking credit for at Tesla (the reason he does not do patents is because he would not be listed as an inventor as putting a fake inventor on a patent would kill it and moreover it would reveal the superstars behind the work). His lust for power is also why he did xAI and Neuralink, to attempt to compete with OpenAI and NeuroVigil, respectively, despite being affiliated with them.

""companies and tried to create rivals. I fired him with cause in December 2021 when he tried to undermine NV.

Elon did two Nazi salutes.

He did them for five main reasons: 

1. He was concerned that the “Nazi wing” of the MAGA movement, under the influence of Steve Bannon, would drive him away from Trump, somewhere in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, rather than in the West Wing which is where he wants to be. He was already feeling raw over the fact that Trump did not follow his recommendation for Treasury Secretary and that the Senate also did not pick his first choice;

2. He was upset that he had had to go to Israel and Auschwitz to make up for agreeing with a Nazi sympathizer online and wanted to reclaim his “power” just like when he told advertisers to “go fuck yourself”. This has nothing to do with Asperger’s;

3. There are some Jews he actually hates: Sam Altman is amongst them;

4. He enjoys a good thrill and knew exactly what he was doing;""","1850","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreidbrshlknxr4p3egfrywynof2437ad6bvhyaskhhsofmav3zzgetu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreidbrshlknxr4p3egfrywynof2437ad6bvhyaskhhsofmav3zzgetu@jpeg","Screenshot of Part 4/8 of Philip Low, former Elon Musk Friend, post on Elon Musk.

""5. His narcissistic self was hoping the audience would reflect his abject gesture back to him, thereby showing complete control and dominion over it, and increasing his leverage over Trump. That did not happen. 

Bottom line: Elon is not a Nazi but he did give two Nazi Salutes, which is completely unacceptable.

N.B. For the few whining about my post “sans connaissance the cause” and either trembling about my having shattered their illusions about their cult leader or thinking I am defending Elon:

I. My point is that he is transactional rather than ideological;

II. That being said, I am not defending him or his actions, just explaining them and confirming that he did, in fact, do two Nazi Salutes if anyone had doubts or believed the doctored footage of Taylor Swift doing the same thing to normalize what Elon did;""","1730","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreigjjfcvhdp7mzey424bq26aygkixdp65biwcbyj6lzgihmgqp33f4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:gihl2qyplkssxnegjppifo4j/bafkreigjjfcvhdp7mzey424bq26aygkixdp65biwcbyj6lzgihmgqp33f4@jpeg","en",,,"47","President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would take a hard line on China, imposing massive tariffs on all Chinese goods entering the United States.","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:7prh6raya2ntwnpyzte5u5hc/bafkreidfq54sahhhjh44q5fhavebqdy4n2mgxpt2a2l6n5f4xfay22waga@jpeg","How do you explain Trump's abrupt pivot on China?

“Um, here’s your check.” She blushed again and placed his bill in front of him. “She paid for what you got her so you didn’t waste your money.”

I first discovered what was killing these men.
I had three sons who worked with their father in the tunnel:
Cecil, aged 23, Owen, aged 21, Shirley, aged 17.
They used to work in a coal mine, not steady work for the mines were not going much of the time.
A power Co. foreman learned that we made home brew, he formed a habit of dropping in evenings to drink, persuading the boys and my husband— give up their jobs and take this other work.
It would pay them better.
Shirley was my youngest son; the boy.
He went into the tunnel.
My heart my mother my heart my mother
My heart my coming into being.
My husband is not able to work.
He has it, according to the doctor.
We have been having a very hard time making a living since this trouble came to us.
I saw the dust in the bottom of the tub.
The boy worked there about eighteen months, came home one evening with a shortness of breath.
He said, ""Mother, I cannot get my breath.""","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","Shirley was sick about three months.
I would carry him from his bed to the table, from his bed to the porch, in my arms.
My heart is mine in the place of hearts, They gave me back my heart, it lies in me.
When they took sick, right at the start, I saw a doctor.
I tried to get Dr. Harless to X-ray the boys.
He was the only man I had any confidence in, the company doctor in the Kopper's mine, but he would not see Shirley.
He did not know where his money was coming from.
I promised him half if he'd work to get compensation, but even then he would not do anything.
I went on the road and begged the X-ray money, the Charleston hospital made the lung pictures, he took the case after the pictures were made.
And two or three doctors said the same thing.
The youngest boy did not get to go down there with me, he lay and said, ""Mother, when I die, I want you to have them open me up and see if that dust killed me.
Try to get compensation,","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreifftbjf6lq2v5rovexf575hipkhooez4d5c6lw766zztcptmppiem@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreifftbjf6lq2v5rovexf575hipkhooez4d5c6lw766zztcptmppiem@jpeg","you will not have any way of making your living when we are gone,

I have gained mastery over my heart
I have gained mastery over my two hands I have gained mastery over the waters I have gained mastery over the river.
The case of my son was the first of the line of lawsuits.
They sent the lawyers down and the doctors down; they closed the electric sockets in the camps.
There was Shirley, and Cecil, Jeffrey and Oren, Raymond Johnson, Clev and Oscar Anders, Frank Lynch, Henry Palf, Mr. Pitch, a foreman; a slim fellow who carried steel with my boys, his name was Darnell, I believe. There were many others, the towns of Glen Ferris, Alloy, where the white rock lies, six miles away; Vanetta, Gauley Bridge, Gamoca, Lockwood, the gullies, the whole valley is witness.
I hitchhike eighteen miles, they make checks out.
They asked me how I keep the cow on $2.
I said one week, feed for the cow, one week, the children's
four.","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreibd7axh5qlht4kgjqo666oglpmeimpxyycm4kw2zcczn45rruwfhi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreibd7axh5qlht4kgjqo666oglpmeimpxyycm4kw2zcczn45rruwfhi@jpeg","The oldest son was twenty-three.
The next son was twenty-one.
The youngest son was eighteen.
They called it pneumonia at first.
They would pronounce it fever.
Shirley asked that we try to find out.
That's how they learned what the trouble was.
I open out a way, they have covered my sky with crystal I come forth by day, I am born a second time, I force a way through, and I know the gate I shall journey over the earth among the living.

“I Love That Name…”

You sit there, absentmindedly stirring your tea as the passerby of this small port town pay you no mind. You know he was suppose to be here today, he said he would because you had something important to tell him. And in all honesty, you have a lot to show him.

You look down at your figure, a cute floral sundress that compliments the shining sun and cooling waves coming from the North Blue ocean. Your nails a pretty sea foam blue to compliment your island locale. 

Would he even take it well? Would he still see you as his old drinking buddy and best friend?Or would he hear you out? Rosinante always loved your sense of humor and felt a kinship with your clumsiness that always followed his own. However since he was gone, you only heard rumor of his return, this time referring to himself as “Corazon.” ","1888","1242","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreiegoptpxqi74dibqgxw5f4qsijx4o5j5ldy4skp2m6teeuhmnokny@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreiegoptpxqi74dibqgxw5f4qsijx4o5j5ldy4skp2m6teeuhmnokny@jpeg","Full Text Description:

Whatever the reason for this change, it must be something important. You finally stop stirring your tea as you go to take a sip. Before the liquid touches your lips you begin to sense something off about your surroundings. As you put your cup back down, you notice no hustle and bustle of the market close by or marines stopping by to inspect the surroundings. The seagulls make no discernible noise even though they obviously are moving their beaks.

Silence. Utter and complete silence, you try to speak but no one seems to hear you in your secluded table of the small cafe. That is when he sits down. 

The immediate form comes into view: A large and gaudy black feather jacket. This is accompanied by a light pink shirt with several red hearts adorning it. Where the center of his chest is lies an opening that reveals his chest, pale but still obviously built. The last feature that sticks out his face. A right eye with spiked blue under eye makeup pairs with an almost clown-like painted smile. A cigarette dangles from his lips, lit and occasionally inhaled.

He stares as you with his hazel brown eyes, looking you up and down, as if he is trying to recognize you. That’s when he pulls from the cigarette yet says nothing. You try to read more of his expression but he seems to hide it well, like a poker player bluffing a bad hand. A few moments pass with no word, and the deafening silence sets in as you still look around with nothing making a sound.

With a click of his tongue, he says, “Wow, it’s interesting to see you like this…” Another drag from his cigarette. 
“Well what is that suppose to mean?” you ask annoyedly. His blunt observation was kind of abrasive. Rosy was always general quiet but kind. Why was he acting this…serious? Did something happen and could it be why he’s going by “Corazon?” 

“So, I got a couple of questions.” He sits with a more relaxed position as he dangles the cigarette back in his mouth. “First, are you happy with your discovery?” ","1913","1242","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreifb6odt5aocfxgibzhbbhvy5i4prn2grsbptdbceyq2r275pvld5q@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreifb6odt5aocfxgibzhbbhvy5i4prn2grsbptdbceyq2r275pvld5q@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"3",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreiegoptpxqi74dibqgxw5f4qsijx4o5j5ldy4skp2m6teeuhmnokny@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","1","1","Listen…I have never written fanfic.

Trawling through the land like the fiery smoke that rose from the battlefields.
	Just as Adrestia seemingly set its sights on Leicester, a revelation of the origins of House Riegan’s current heir tore their unity asunder. Claude von Riegan hailed from Almyra, sired by the long-missing Tiana von Riegan and the reigning king, that he was known as Khalid in his motherland. It was enough to erupt the entire Alliance in chaos.
	The news had shocked Dimitri, but he had more pressing issues: routing his uncle’s supporters, repairing his country from Rufus’ incompetent reign, preparing his people for the war Adrestia would likely bring to their doorstep. There was no time, no energy, no resources, to officially spare in mitigating or investigating the disaster unfolding to the east.
	Last he had heard, Claude von Riegan had been forcibly ousted from his position, placed under arrest under suspicion of espionage on behalf of Almyra, and that was before Almyra officially disowned him. He was held in Gloucester, awaiting trial, fate uncertain.
Until he escaped.
An Alliance-wide manhunt ensued. With every passing moon that he went unfound, the bounty for him rose. Some theorized he had made it across the border back into his home country to disappear, or similarly fled from Fódlan on a ship from Derdriu.
Either way, it seemed as if he had simply vanished.
Then, reports of ambushes on Adrestian soldiers began to spread, bearing marks of neither Alliance or Church doing. Poisoned arrows, poisoned food or water supplies. Traps set in the nearby woods, spike or rock-lined pitfalls and snares that left soldiers hanging from the trees.

Bodies riddled with arrows, signaling shots that only an experienced, exceedingly skilled archer could make. It was deliberate, and taunting.
Rumors spread.
And now, suspicions have given way to the truth standing before him, the proof coming from Claude’s own silver-tongued mouth.
But the man in front of him now is not the smiling boy from Garreg Mach, making jokes and making friends with a laugh that rang more sweetly than the chapel bells. There is a smile, to be sure—but it is hard, and cold, and cruel. His eyes are fire-glazed jade. Opaque. Dangerously calm, and deeply furious.
“What’s the matter, Mitri? I thought you had questions for me.”
Even his voice is different, delivered with a sharp, serrated edge that cuts invisible lines up Dimitri’s arms, even beneath his gauntlets.
Dimitri takes in a deep breath.
“I do.”
But he also wants to look.
There are dark circles beneath Claude’s eyes, his hair a long and barely coherent mess of dark waves that disappear into the back of his hooded scarf. His cheekbones cut out sharply, as does his jawline. His hands are bare at the moment, the fingernails brittle. He hasn’t been eating properly in who knows how long—who knows how Claude had stayed alive, undetected for so long after being wanted in two countries. Three, once he had started striking down the Church’s knights and therefore made it Faerghus’ problem by association.
And then there’s the scar…running from his nose, across his cheek, and disappearing around to where half his missing ear used to be.

""Dimitri wants to be angry. But somehow, he can’t summon the one emotion that is so familiar, he takes it with him to sleep.
“Why are you targeting Adrestian camps?”
Claude yawns. “Why shouldn’t I?”
“If it’s revenge you wanted, wouldn’t you have gone directly after the Alliance leaders? The ones who called for your abdication as heir of house Riegan?”
“Who said I wanted revenge?”
Dimitri sighs, and rubs his forehead.
“What else could you possibly want?”
“Now that’s a good question.” Claude smiles with a hint of teeth.
That makes Dimitri pause, and in the silence, Claude’s lip pulls higher. Their eyes catch, and it’s steady.
“…So.”
“So.” Claude echoes.
“What could you gain by targeting Adrestia? While making it so obvious it was you.” Dimitri muses, rubbing a hand over his jaw, while Claude tilts his head and shrugs.
Claude had left enough signs that he might as well have signed his name to the carnage he left behind, carving a trail across the country. It had only been because he’d traversed so deeply into Adrestia, that he’d eventually ended up in Western Faerghus to follow the invading army.","1152","1104","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:hhh5calcm5rnmeoffblmuoom/bafkreiafpm7smtn7pzfvvwhrfvgl3hixvu5yfhgbgjnyf3rpj6clgcxatm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:hhh5calcm5rnmeoffblmuoom/bafkreiafpm7smtn7pzfvvwhrfvgl3hixvu5yfhgbgjnyf3rpj6clgcxatm@jpeg","“I doubt you are trying to win the war single-handedly on the Alliance’s behalf,” Dimitri says carefully. “And I presume you aren’t helping our cause out of the goodness of your heart.”

Minegishi had just finished making their professor's introduction and asks that if anyone were to ask questions about them, they keep it professional. But before they could finish their sentence, a female student asks if they're single. On the other hand, Shimazaki finds the situation awkward and wished he hadn't gone to class. Minegishi then answers the student, lying through their teeth saying they are married, but Shimazaki was at shock and believed this.

The spot was Chicago and he hadn't intended to stop there at all. After six gruelling days in New York he'd been out at the airport, ready to Flagship back to California, when the home office called and asked him to stop off in Chicago to see an important prospect.
So here he was, an hour before his appointment, carrying a bag full of dirty laundry and wearing yesterday's soiled shirt. That was why he asked American Airlines Ticket Agent Harry McKenzie, ""Where's the nearest place I can buy a clean shirt in a hurry?""
Only then did he realize the spot he was in. For McKenzie gently reminded him, ""It's Sunday, sir, all the stores will be closed.""
Gloomily he outlined to McKenzie the story of his unexpected business in Chicago. McKenzie was a sympathetic man and fortunately a man of action too. ""If you'll tell me your shirt size, sir,"" he suggested, ""maybe I can help you."" And then he hurried off.
In an amazingly short time, McKenzie was back, a clean white shirt in hand. (He'd found an American Airlines' agent with the same shirt size who lived near the airport.)
Five minutes later the passenger emerged from the washroom looking as neat and trim as Easter Sunday-and twice as joyous. All of which answers the question-Should an airline give a passenger the shirt off its back? We, at American, say yes.

It feels a little bloated. However, even as it makes reading the book less enjoyable, the level of detail reminds you that these are all individual people, children, with lives and dreams and fears, being tortured and slaughtered, not numbers. In seeing a little of each life, no matter how sparse, we see more fully every death.

In a similar tension, the violence and gore is a bit more brutal than the film, which makes it feel pulpy sometimes — but at other times, it's effective in heightening the dissonance between the glossy, caring facade of what Takami describes as ""successful fascism,"" and the nauseatingly cruel reality of fascism, its calculated yet senseless violence. A fascinating effect when it appears, even if the book largely falls into the category of exploitation pulp, missing a more articulate satire in its lack of subtlety.","1857","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","Maybe the connotations of ""exploitation"" are a bit misleading here, though; there's a palpable anger behind the hyperviolence, not an aim to cash in, at least on the author's part, not that I can sense — a louder, more visceral expression of youth unrest in 90s Japan. Snapshots of what youth become, what they become capable of doing and compelled to do, in such an oppressive world. Takami's 2009 afterword is revealing; he writes that ""the nation that would serve as the setting for the novel was added later,"" but ""Still, I thought that figurative county couldn't be written any differently [...] I wanted to write about the trapped feeling of living in Japan I've felt clearly since childhood — at the very least, from middle school on [...] When I was born, near the end of the '60s, there existed even in Japan the sort of culture where a college student would throw Molotov cocktails at police. But in the '80s, when I was a teenager, that environment had vanished. Maybe everyone became disillusioned when they discovered that even throwing Molotov cocktails at police didn't change anything. This may be related to my feeling of trapped hopelessness.""

Battle Royale was rejected in the final round of the 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, leaving no winner that year; the judges admitted it was the best work, but as judge Mariko Hayashi put it, ""I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this."" The decade preceding its publication was marked by the murder of Junko Furuta and the Kobe child murders, the decade following by Tsutomu Miyazaki's serial murders and the Sasebo slashing —and, in the US, Columbine. It has gone on to become a cult hit globally and shaped popular culture deeply. It spoke (and speaks) to coming of age in an increasingly pressurized world that warps and crushes, of eating or being eaten and finding the strength to choose neither, to keep running.

And, ultimately, I think that that matters more than the prose being amateur, the characters sometimes flat and hamfisted. The roughness is part of that feeling Battle Royale evokes: the raw, juvenile cry for help.","2000","1019","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","en",,,"2",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreidceixvnmoyivcavhp43d3tddpjf73cvteyf3ueztbovkufgcae6y@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","1","0","📚🌟3️⃣ BATTLE ROYALE 📖 バトル・ロワイアル (remastered ver., koushun takami, 1999 / 2014, tr. nathan collins) www.bookwormreads.co/rubyfire77/s...","https://bsky.app/profile/rubyfire77.bsky.social/post/3lj72tztcq22m"

As for what was hapenning story wise...after McDonough/Patyk were fired, another writer was brought to finish off their plotlines. (He wanted to go uncredited since he was stuck finishing off MC-Patyk's and didn't want to be associated with it. So anyways mr. newguy wrote the second half of G1 #11 (which Don pencilled completly), and had finished about half of #12 (which guido mostly pencilled) at the time DW shut down. so that's all that was actually written. (there was a WICKED scene this guy wrote between shockwave, megatron, starscream and soundwave at the end of issue #11 that's jsut about my fave TF scene that Don drew)

The plans after that though were , newguy would finsh of the old stories with #13, and then Simon Furman was going to write a 1-off story for #14. It was gunna something with Jetfire and the Fallen. Basically establishign that jetfire was not killed, tieing up some stuff from War Within II, and I think bringing the fallen into the modern G1 time period.

After that Chris Sarracini was going to come on as the regular writer with issue #15. I believe he was going to start with a space journey for Optimus and a group of autobots, chasing after megatron for some reason...


The datatracks annual would've had an 13page story by Chris Sarracini, with the rest of the 48 pager being filled with new profiles, and a few other goodies like a tf timeline that showed where/when every DW story and event fit in together. I was actually going to get to write the profiles parts of the book myself, though at the time of DW's closing all that I had written were a couple profiles (Bumper and I think one for the planet Paradron) and a rough of that TF Time line...","2000","932","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cinazhyeoo4yvaff2gkizbsl/bafkreiejvoxpxdauvprh5vwrcwbu3y645ljyb5zyjdbx6k4vzxy6nvkmhe@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cinazhyeoo4yvaff2gkizbsl/bafkreiejvoxpxdauvprh5vwrcwbu3y645ljyb5zyjdbx6k4vzxy6nvkmhe@jpeg","Well, if you want the inside scoop... the Mick/McDonough/Patyk love triangle were solely responsible for some pretty major continuity errors, but not due to sloppyness. It was the simple fact that they didn't give a damn about what had gone before, and purposely ignored or changed anything that didn't fit into their story, but they were well aware of the previous content. That includes moments like the Insecticons, Blitzwing, and Red Alert being on the ark II/earth, that General Halo caused the ark II tragedy, Wheeljack's death... and a pile of other things they ignored. I called out a lot of those things specifically to McDonut and his response was that he didn't really care.

They even went and added that War Within flashback into G1 where Starscream kills the Cybertron high council, without even asking or telling Simon about it. He was understandably pretty peeved about that, as I think he's mentioned in interviews....

But anyways, the last I saw them was at a transformerscon panel were they just went on & on about how Simon had stolen all their Beast Wars ideas.

Reson for notice is as follows: 
My wife and I have been photographed, surveilled, harassed and intimidated and we fear for our lives and well-being. Since Laffin built his home and moved in next door and began calling the By-Law officers on me for no reason other than to cause me grief due to my refusal to move my well so he could put his septic close to my water supply, the City employees have been surveilling me, and visiting my property regularly, with Ken [REDACTED] assisting them, acting as a private investigator, by reporting our whereabouts and taking photos from the bushes. It then escalated when I became VP of the Kawartha Lake Tax Payers Association, where as a group, we have challenged the City at Council meetings. It got even worse when they discovered I have laid private prosecution charges on all of them. They have made false accusations, cited phony by-laws, changed my zoning to EP without my consent, and have me in court defending myself against false charges with ridiculously high fines, of which the City pockets 100% of the money. They are abusing their power, trying to waste my time, scare my wife and cost me so much money that I can no longer pay property tax so they can foreclose, selling properties while keeping 100% of the money. We live in an isolated area with no police around and we fear for our safety. My wife will no longer go outside to help with maintenance and will not be left alone at home. This NOTICE be in effect for one full year, from Nov 29 2024 to Nov 28 2025, or until our legal issues have been resolved in court, whichever is longest, and I also request that the City pay to have security cameras installed at my house so my family can feel safe.","843","661","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3r4ouyv7apmuujvdfiklmlv/bafkreifrskpc7nhm7rjpnz73olmv5iqhinzrgpvxtnb3ofjbcauzyxi3ue@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n3r4ouyv7apmuujvdfiklmlv/bafkreifrskpc7nhm7rjpnz73olmv5iqhinzrgpvxtnb3ofjbcauzyxi3ue@jpeg","en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n3r4ouyv7apmuujvdfiklmlv/bafkreicdjdii3sreqx6of5fmzzotaaggmbyrsdxjox4gdelkkw6v5z56ze@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","2","0","Update: I have been CC'd on the ""official"" no-trespass order.

edit
In addition to broader criticism of MAID, the handling of certain cases have been subject to media coverage. These include:

In 2017, a mother of a young woman with cerebral palsy was told by a doctor that not applying for MAID was ""selfish"". Her daughter was in the room when the conversation took place and described the experience as traumatic.[71]
In 2018, Roger Foley was being treated for cerebellar ataxia at an Ontario hospital. Foley alleged that his only options were to be forcibly discharged from the hospital and then treated by an organization that had previously failed to provide him adequate care or apply for MAID. Foley hired a lawyer for a charter challenge.[72]
In 2019, Alan Nichols successfully applied for MAID while being hospitalized for suicide ideation. The reason given on his application was hearing loss.[1]","1756","1079","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:n4xnkejnt37mkg7td4vkzuxe/bafkreifz6wm42j44ly6mmopm45tn3zqmdrk52ndjzguaplkzvarv3eczdi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:n4xnkejnt37mkg7td4vkzuxe/bafkreifz6wm42j44ly6mmopm45tn3zqmdrk52ndjzguaplkzvarv3eczdi@jpeg","In February 2022, an anonymous Torontonian suffering from extreme chemical sensitivity syndrome with the pseudonym Sophia had a medically assisted death after failing to find affordable housing that was free from tobacco smoke and other chemicals.[73] This case was addressed by her health care provider in testimony provided to the Special Joint Committee on MAID, and was referenced in their final report.[74]
In October 2022, a man from St. Catharines applied for MAID when facing homelessness.[75] After receiving $60,000 from a GoFundMe campaign, he was able to find a place to live and withdrew his application.[76]
In November 2022, an anonymous active Canadian Forces member has alleged he was offered MAID when seeking assistance regarding PTSD and suicidal thoughts.[77]

I'm not the kind of woman who will look away when you talk about rape, abuse, or addiction. I won't flinch when you walk in covered in dirt, much, and inner shit.  I won't judge your story of neglect, betrayal, or trauma.  I won't try to re-write your suicidal thoughts or self hatred. I won't ignore your cry. I won't back away from your drool, vomit, or blood. I won't deny the relationship you have with your womb, work, or the unseen. I won't belittle your body-image or self-wisdom. I won't pretend I have an answer for you. I won't compare your divorce, break- up or loss to another. Because I believe you. I believe you when you say what you've been through, what you're in, and all that you carry. I believe it when you say that you've tried, you want to, and that you will. I believe you now, and I will continue believing in you. Because I am the kind of woman who holds space. For you, sister. ""
I will add, sister, brother, or others. I am not alone. there are millions of us who support everyone, humankind.

Post Dressrosa Doflamingo wakes up chained to the floor in a mysterious prison cell. He's bored, thirsty, & really tired of just about everything.

The only interesting thing to do is theorize about who might've taken him. It could be anyone, he'd made plenty of enemies over the years. All he knew for sure was that this wasn't a Marine Prison. The vibes were all wrong.

Of all the people he thought it might be, he wasn't expecting Crocodile

He definitely wasn't expecting his ex to be quite so personally cruel & chatty.

They ended things on good terms didn't they?

But then maybe for men like them the best time to do couples therapy really was when one of you was chained to the floor

Doffy couldn't imagine a more hilarious way for his imprisonment to go down & if he played his cards right, this whole prison era might not be so boring after all","2000","1007","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:htf7c6diiepvagdqhonh5fif/bafkreidd3cztsr4eoj753prmvwqdk6jgui4hd3uut37yhkmsajet6s3yhy@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:htf7c6diiepvagdqhonh5fif/bafkreidd3cztsr4eoj753prmvwqdk6jgui4hd3uut37yhkmsajet6s3yhy@jpeg","Text reading:

Post Dressrosa Doflamingo wakes up chained to the floor in a mysterious prison cell. He's bored, thirsty, & really tired of just about everything.

The only interesting thing to do is theorize about who might've taken him. It could be anyone, he'd made plenty of enemies over the years. All he knew for sure was that this wasn't a Marine Prison. The vibes were all wrong.

Of all the people he thought it might be, he wasn't expecting Crocodile

He definitely wasn't expecting his ex to be quite so personally cruel & chatty.

They ended things on good terms didn't they?

But then maybe for men like them the best time to do couples therapy really was when one of you was chained to the floor

Doffy couldn't imagine a more hilarious way for his imprisonment to go down & if he played his cards right, this whole prison era might not be so boring after all","2000","1007","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:htf7c6diiepvagdqhonh5fif/bafkreidd3cztsr4eoj753prmvwqdk6jgui4hd3uut37yhkmsajet6s3yhy@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:htf7c6diiepvagdqhonh5fif/bafkreidd3cztsr4eoj753prmvwqdk6jgui4hd3uut37yhkmsajet6s3yhy@jpeg","Text reading:

Press Release
“On Tuesday, January 21, the United States Capitol Police (USCP) received a lookout for a man with reported mental health issues and suicidal thoughts who was believed to be armed and in the area. At approximately 1:15 p.m., USCP officers spotted the man’s car on First Street, near East Capitol Street, NE. Officers conducted a canvass of the area and discovered that the man had recently entered the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and taken a Capitol tour. At approximately 2:15 p.m., the man was found leaving the Library of Congress, after the tour, and walking towards his car. He was stopped, searched, and arrested. A small 9mm handgun was discovered, concealed in his waistband. The suspect, 27-year-old James A. Faber of Massachusetts, was arrested for Unlawful Activities, Carrying a Pistol Without a License, Possession of an Unregistered Firearm, Unlawful Possession of Ammunition, and Resisting Arrest. The case is currently with the U.S. Attorney’s Office. USCP security video shows the man entered through the south CVC checkpoint. After the magnetometers sounded, an officer performed a secondary hand search, and the man was let into the building. The officer is suspended while the USCP’s Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting an administrative investigation into the officer’s performance of that search. At this time, there is no indication that the man was coming to harm the Congress. Thankfully nobody was hurt. The USCP demands the highest standards when it comes to screening visitors, so a full review of this incident has already been ordered, as well as mandatory refresher training on security screening, so this never happens again.” – The United States Capitol Police","2000","1086","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:epx5kbkcyr53y5egrh7hitld/bafkreigntii2fdegafz7xgveosc4tltmvpk4hl5eg2hn2dkluwu2h4kfq4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:epx5kbkcyr53y5egrh7hitld/bafkreigntii2fdegafz7xgveosc4tltmvpk4hl5eg2hn2dkluwu2h4kfq4@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:epx5kbkcyr53y5egrh7hitld/bafkreihdvgi4fexg3sbpqholjsaiouimr5asfdqvjgy2vco57e5pk3gcyu@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","0","0","

Schools are in a unique position to create safe and supportive environments, free from violence and bullying, for all students, including transgender and questioning students. Violence, poor mental health, and suicide are not caused by any single factor, and prevention will not be achieved by any single strategy. However, strategies that create safe and supportive environments inclusive of transgender students and promote school connectedness can improve the health and well-being of transgender students across a range of outcomes.
Evidence supports the association of CDC's What Works in Schools (WWIS) approach (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/whatworks
works-overview.htm) with reductions in experiences of violence, poor mental health, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among high school students (12).

Why do people never talk about the part of depression when you just don't want anything anymore? Everybody talks about when it hurts like hell, when you cry, when you cut, when you take drugs, when you break down. But no one ever talks about when you just lay down in your room, with a hole inside of you that you don't know how to fill, and you don't want to do anything even the things you usually like. So you just spend your day kinda waiting for it to end.

Comorbidity and polypharmacy are common in antidepressant users, increasing the likelihood of interaction-related adverse drug events, which are frequently preventable.Aim We aimed to identify, profile, and analyse potential antidepressant drug–drug interactions in information-seeking antidepressant users.Methods We retrospectively analysed antidepressant-related drug–drug interaction enquiries from patients or carers who contacted a pharmacist-led Australian national medicines call centre over an 8-year period to determine patient characteristics, concomitant drugs involved, prevalence and type of antidepressant-related drug–drug interaction across life stages, and associated risks.Results Of 3899 antidepressant drug–drug interaction calls, the most frequent concomitant drugs were antipsychotics, opioids, benzodiazepines, and complementary medicines. Narrative analyses of 2011 calls identified 81.0% of patients with potential drug–drug interactions and 10.4% categorised with worrying symptoms. The most frequent drug–drug interaction risks were excessive sedation, increased anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome, and suicidal thoughts. Carers of children aged <15 years and older adults (65–74 years) were more likely to report experiencing worrying symptoms. Although more potential pharmacodynamic than pharmacokinetic interactions were recorded, pharmacokinetic interactions tended to have more significant clinical impact.Discussion Antidepressant users often have information gaps and safety concerns regarding drug–drug interactions that motivate help-seeking behaviour. Symptoms and drug–drug interaction consequences may be underestimated in these patients. Primary care health professionals have a role in proactively addressing the risk of drug–drug interactions to support benefit-risk assessment and shared decision-making.",,"Patient concerns regarding antidepressant drug–drug interactions: a retrospective analysis using data from a medicines call centre","https://www.publish.csiro.au/HC/HC21150",,"suicidal thoughts","0","0","https://www.publish.csiro.au/HC/HC21150

""The Suicide Scale"" by an artist credited as
""Emmengard."" It outlines ten levels of mental health states in a progression from extreme happiness to active suicidal behavior. Each level is visually represented with a cartoon figure and includes text describing the corresponding thoughts, feelings, or actions.
Here is a concise description of the individual levels:

1. Extreme Happiness: The character is smiling widely, labeled ""This is almost too much joy,"" with a caption stating,
""My abs hurt from laughing.""

2. Feeling Pretty Good: The character looks serene and content, surrounded by flowers and greenery, indicating mild happiness.

3. Low Mood: The character appears

worried and confused, expressing a feeling of hopelessness.

4. Mild Frustration: The character sits at a desk with expressions of stress, commenting on unrelated trivial problems.

5. Dark Humor: The character jokes about death and exhibits intrusive suicidal ideation without intent, shown with speech bubbles referencing ""dark jokes.""

6. Serious Suicidal Ideation: The character contemplates self-harm but resists acting on the thoughts, shown writing in a journal.

7. Breaking Down: The character loses control over thoughts and starts making plans, overwhelmed by skulls symbolizing death surrounding them.

8. Forming a Plan: The character begins taking preparatory steps, seeking a sense of closure or resolution with others.

9. Active Planning: The character prepares for suicide, actively isolating themselves and leaving goodbyes.

10. Immediate Danger: A red ambulance illustrates an emergency","697","720","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:muhesxre7yfcuqi5ss2fskjc/bafkreigcl5ptixmrurpypuyinjltdezxfm2lca46isp6fbjpy4qkt5vl74@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:muhesxre7yfcuqi5ss2fskjc/bafkreigcl5ptixmrurpypuyinjltdezxfm2lca46isp6fbjpy4qkt5vl74@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"9",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:muhesxre7yfcuqi5ss2fskjc/bafkreigcl5ptixmrurpypuyinjltdezxfm2lca46isp6fbjpy4qkt5vl74@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","0","3","Actually we're twinsies because I think I'm pretty much five too.

The majority of the patients (90.5%) reported a lack of understanding of their disease, resulting in patients avoiding talking about the disease due to disbelief, trivialization and avoidance of negative reactions. They felt most supported by close family members (67.1%). Two thirds of the patients (68.5%) experienced stigmatization.
ME/CFS had a negative impact on mental health in most patients (88.2%), leading to sadness (71%), hopelessness for relief (66.9%), suicidal thoughts (39.3%) and secondary depression (14.8%). Half of the male patients experienced at least one suicidal thought since clinical onset.
Factors significantly associated with depression were the lack of cure, disabilities associated with ME/CFS, social isolation and the fact that life was not worth anymore with ME/CFS. The three main factors contributing to suicidal thoughts were (i) being told the disease was only psychosomatic (89.5%), (ii) being at the end of one's strength (80.7%) and (iii) not feeling","1846","1170","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2aylwwoxvcrohglyve4hzlaz/bafkreid32eh6bqlwvy7x5ntrwpj5umb36v7lacfccqoi44z7lkp7pzqhxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:2aylwwoxvcrohglyve4hzlaz/bafkreid32eh6bqlwvy7x5ntrwpj5umb36v7lacfccqoi44z7lkp7pzqhxq@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"de",,,"30",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2aylwwoxvcrohglyve4hzlaz/bafkreid32eh6bqlwvy7x5ntrwpj5umb36v7lacfccqoi44z7lkp7pzqhxq@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","1","15","CN Suizidalität, Saneismus, Medical Gaslighting

This shit just keeps dragging on and on and on, and every time I see a light at the end of the tunnel it immediately disappears and I'm stuck where I was before - if not even worse off.

I have little faith that I'll get my EIT certification first-go in January, and I'm not allowed to take it again for some time afterwards (let alone how EXPENSIVE it is), so there goes that being a positive thing on my resume in a month or two.

The fact that I'm not even finding part time work that isn't super seasonal or wouldn't break my body and/or soul, either... I just Can't anymore, y'all. I just Can't.

Being in such a financial rut isn't helping shit, either, of course.

The thoughts keep persisting and while I know it's the worst possible ""solution"" (sure, it solves my problems, by removing myself entirely), it's still a solution and an increasingly tempting one because I'm getting fucking zero leads.

Toss in the recently brought-back reminders of when I'm pretty certain I got sexually assaulted years ago also fucking my brain up, and I'm just left here thinking what do I do? I keep questioning if I should even be in a relationship, but also my fiancé by my side is the one constant positive thing I have right now. Leaving them right now would break me, I feel like even more than I already am broken.

Summary:
“Helmeppo?” There was a tremor in Coby’s voice. “Can I join you?”

Helmeppo shrugged, which Coby apparently took as an invitation. His legs swung idly over the edge of the roof, a blur of movement in Helmeppo’s periphery.

“Long way down,” Coby murmured.

It sounded like a warning. Like a plea, perhaps.

“Yeah.” Helmeppo loosened the curl of his fingers, only to lay back and tuck his arms beneath his head, burning in the unrelenting glare of the sun. “Sure is.”","1279","1047","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreick6rxspwbcka4hyduvfn2npsb7fpvzqnhfyzhpzlbcsg224qo3ru@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreick6rxspwbcka4hyduvfn2npsb7fpvzqnhfyzhpzlbcsg224qo3ru@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ro36nyn7m6b4pg4h545rvtll/bafkreick6rxspwbcka4hyduvfn2npsb7fpvzqnhfyzhpzlbcsg224qo3ru@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","1","0","""Long Way Down""

Summary

Viktor opened his eyes wide and looked around. His heart beat fast in his chest. There was dirt on his hands and he could smell the polluted river next to him, feel the itchiness of rough clothes on his skin, the warmth of the sun...
Where was he?
He tried to stand up, tried to take in his surroundings and gasped.
This place... he knew this place.
---
Jayce and Viktor wake up in another time, maybe another universe, but... they've landed further back than anybody could have anticipated.
Well, that means they have more time to fix things... right?
Or is it just a chance to make new mistakes?
---
New chapter every day!

…man, is a parent, and struggles with overwhelming anxiety, this book was very triggering but also so, so relatable.

As with many books I read, I think everyone should read this book. I think it would be significant to all partners, parents, adult children, teachers, white folks, artists, immigrants, etc. I think the takeaways will be different for each group/person but all so worth it.

This book is affirming in that healing isn't linear.

Summary:
To be honest it's been a long time since Yoongi felt genuinely happy. His life feels like a cage he can't escape. And it's not like he never tried to live the life he wanted to live. He did - and it ended horribly somehow. So people really shouldn't blame him for wanting to end his life or at least thinking about it. He didn't expect his life to get better at this point.
Then again he also didn't expect Park Jimin to stumble into his life as well - with two little hands grabbed in his.

Still one of my favorite books ever. I'm no longer in university, but the narrator's thoughts are still so very relatable - her inability to love well, falling into despair when thinking about the future, even her occasional thoughts of what makes life worth living, despite the struggling or because of it?

This is definitely not a book to read if not mentally well, but the writing, characters, and their relationships are all so beautiful and layered and complex, with some wonderful queer friendships as well. Definitely a must-read lesbian classic.","1963","1570","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:emsvnc6mykbtjbltj3te3n4t/bafkreiguaxr6ptd6q6k5qn6jgpbxcdox6po2dm7bl5jvhiraa23kyekowi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:emsvnc6mykbtjbltj3te3n4t/bafkreiguaxr6ptd6q6k5qn6jgpbxcdox6po2dm7bl5jvhiraa23kyekowi@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"6",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:emsvnc6mykbtjbltj3te3n4t/bafkreidahd6ihcn6btjz4omy7bmz4vkk3vrdrwtobcawu7wsryqie4tnaq@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","1","2","Notes of a Crocodile by Qiu Miaojin, translated by Bonnie Huie: 5 ⭐

There's a new serial killer haunting Maryland every bit as brilliant & terrifyingly creative as The Chesapeake Ripper... or the Ripper is becoming something new.

The FBI needs to know which one it is

When Quantico Professor Will Graham refuses to waste his time on a crime scene that he's sure is nothing like a Ripper murder, the FBI has to look somewhere else.

Desperate times call for desperate measures, luckily the prestigious psychologist Dr Hannibal Lecter is just the man for the job.

What does Hannibal see when he looks into the depths of this horrifying murder?

Let’s be clear: I couldn't care less about what right-wing trolls on the internet say about me. I don’t care if they talk about my mental health, my weight, or my work. What I do care about is the culture they promote—the culture that makes it harder for those who are struggling to get the help they need.

The truth is, I ignored my anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts for nearly 20 years. It almost killed me. I wasn’t able to ask for help, let alone accept it. I believed that admitting something was wrong meant I was weak. I felt like I was failing everyone in my life. I now know real strength comes from vulnerability and empathy instead.

People should feel safe and secure in reaching out to friends, family, and their community, saying, “I need help. Something’s wrong. I need to talk to someone.” But when powerful people on this website, personally amplified in our","1907","1079","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ziejbbdqlsvt6twa35gdutgl/bafkreihiin4aplngfqxouqgc2ohzs6o3juafhopconfvz5ipggxpq5jil4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ziejbbdqlsvt6twa35gdutgl/bafkreihiin4aplngfqxouqgc2ohzs6o3juafhopconfvz5ipggxpq5jil4@jpeg","use this platform to tear people down for speaking about their struggles, it only makes it harder for others to come forward.

There are people who aren’t here today because they lost their battle with things like suicidal ideation, alcoholism, drug addiction, and more. They might be here if they had received the help they needed if others had been more compassionate and empathetic. They might be here if a permission structure was created that made it easier for them to get help. That’s why we see so many deaths of despair in this country.

Not only is MAGA world coming after me for my mental health and my willingness to discuss it, but they also prey on people—especially white men—who are in similar situations.

I feel for them, and I hope they can eventually see that the content they’re consuming, the things that they’re saying, and the world they’ve been pulled into are exploiting them to empower people who don’t care about them.

I hope they can break free and start seeing the world with more empathy and compassion. It’s, again, a big part of the conversation we’ve been leading at #WhiteDudesforHarris this month. It’s important.

Based on a psychological approach known as dialectical behaviour therapy, which involves practices such as mindfulness of emotions and paced breathing, the hope was that it could help prevent suicidal behaviour in at-risk patients.

Over the course of 12 months, 19,000 of its patients who had reported frequent suicidal thoughts were randomised into three groups. The control group received standard care, the second group received regular outreach to assess their suicide risk on top of their usual care, while the third group were given the digital tool in addition to care. Yet when the outcomes were assessed, it was found that the third group actually fared worse. Using the tool seemed to greatly increase their risk of self-harming compared with just receiving ordinary care.","1579","1284","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:hakzua5btcgcfjye2yujlhos/bafkreibpave2k6m3xr7tdpg2oxvbmpi5wqqmptzzs3ubklcubkhr7twd4i@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:hakzua5btcgcfjye2yujlhos/bafkreibpave2k6m3xr7tdpg2oxvbmpi5wqqmptzzs3ubklcubkhr7twd4i@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"964","As experts worry over privacy issues, ineffectiveness and even harm, the UK is looking at whether the plethora of digital mental health tools need regulating","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:hakzua5btcgcfjye2yujlhos/bafkreihwxrw6jqqa44fjak22w3uqwklj5umclv67lyxlrkghabl4pwyqqq@jpeg","‘They thought they were doing good but it made people worse’: why mental health apps are under s...","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/04/they-thought-they-were-doing-good-but-it-made-people-worse-why-mental-health-apps-are-under-scrutiny","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:hakzua5btcgcfjye2yujlhos/bafkreibpave2k6m3xr7tdpg2oxvbmpi5wqqmptzzs3ubklcubkhr7twd4i@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal thoughts","31","444","Oh.","https://bsky.app/profile/hypervisible.bsky.social/post/3kklwic7gks2c"
