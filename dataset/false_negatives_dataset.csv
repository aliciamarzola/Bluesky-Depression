I’m so sorry. This is like the worst possible way to reply to someone who reaches out. FWIW I’m going through a depressive episode too so my thoughts go out to you.,0
"i started out with a bunch of rage memes, using this as my place to vent… then i realized i was screaming into an empty void  now i just want to find my friends before they (and i) disappear from fb.",0
"Even if I get shit figured out, I'm still gonna wanna kms again in a year or so, is it really worth it to work hard if I'll just feel worse again?",0
having a lot of pain so i'm going to have to stop drawing for the night because i can't sit up at all. trying not to feel frustrated because it's not like i didn't get anything done today. i just didn't get as much done as i'd hoped to. ah well.,0
this! it’s so hard. you feel like such a burden and a bother. also with me i don’t like hearing things like “i’m sorry” or “it gets better” i’m not sure where it came from but this year specifically i’ve found it to be so unhelpful and triggering. so being silent and alone is just easier.,0
"I need to get a journal so I can write all the dumb, depressive, and jealous thoughts down, then scrunch them up and throw them in the trash where they belong.",0
"""I wish it was easier."" I say. 
But 
I really wish it was better. 
That existing didn't 
Burden your bones. 
That pain didn't nest so deeply. 
Overwhelming
Your ability to be 
Without some form of agony. 

I wish it was better 
For you and me.",0
"I had a thought about suicidal ideation converging with reality, when the thoughts take the form of wanting to throw myself in front of a bus and how the election results felt like being thrown under the bus. It was hysterically funny to me but it's not the kind of humor I can share, alas.",0
"I seem to have a lot of neurodivergent comorbidities, one of those is being bipolar.

It has been more than 2 years since the diagnosis, and I am still getting used to all this. 

Depressive episodes can sometimes be too much.

Normally seeing pretty sapphic fan art helps, other times it does not.",0
[worst fucking day. horrible day.],0
i wish i could break the mirror that makes me feel like i should fucking disappear and drown my demons in a bathtub filled with tears no matter what i try they always seem to come back to life   meeeeuuuu,0
theres been very very few days since i tried to kill myself 9 years ago that i havent spent deeply regretting that the attempt didnt work,0
"I wish I could just disappear and leave every feeling behind… every failure, every pain…
When I was younger I wished I could succeed in a art career… but being denied art academy at your age really struck me in the wrong way…
Now I’m a soulless being… without anything valuable in my life…",0
"already up to 500 followers here, which is more than i had on twitter as recently as june! it is really starting to feel empty over there but not full here yet either",0
"I remember telling a friend that I had suicidal ideations before I was a teen, that I once tried to strangle myself my own hands (which of course wasn't going to work) when I was 12.

She just said to me ""oh sweetie that's not normal."" Our heads are pretty fucked up with out thoughts ",0
"I hate that I feel that if I don’t disclose 3+ years of intense trauma to anyone I care about and want to be a more important part of my life, I feel like I’m tricking them or being dishonest. 

I want to not feel like I HAVE to relive it all with every single person I like.",0
"How do you stop the thought of ""if you disappeared off of this planet, no one would miss you or even notice"" from permeating your every waking thought?

Because hell if I knew how to get it to stop. And it's a goddamn mood killer.",0
"when you are an empty shell of a person you will do that in order to try to feel something i guess. (i was never an empty enough shell to do it, but…)",0
I like the little kayfabe I have with my therapist where he asks me if I've had suicidal thoughts and I say no and he writes it down and we both pretend it's true because it legally has to be,0
Like I live life with the assumption that if I disappeared tomorrow no one would notice or care and when that gets challenged by genuine love I crack idk,0
"greetings from the hamter depression pit, it has been 2 weeks of not existing and im still not sure when or how im supposed to feel better lmao

I also realise ive been isolating myself a lot and ive barely interacted with any of my friends recently, just know it's not personal and I miss you all.",0
havent been able to think abt anything today aside from passive suicidal thoughts.  vending machine at school gave me two string cheeses.,0
