Acknowledging that I'm probably gonna die a lonely POS should give me clarity or peace but it mostly just makes me wanna self-destruct quicker,1
"im out my mental slump, seasonal depression + suicidal thoughts is really scary but im still here",1
"I feel insane because everyone around me seems to have accepted empty, driverless cars driving around Los Angeles as normal but it makes me feel weird and bad.",1
"nothing is left, i feel empty inside",1
"Okay, it's T's bday and I need to do something to make it birthday-like. I'll be back eventually.",1
"I hate that I feel that if I don’t disclose 3+ years of intense trauma to anyone I care about and want to be a more important part of my life, I feel like I’m tricking them or being dishonest. 

I want to not feel like I HAVE to relive it all with every single person I like.",1
"do you ever think ‘what the hell is wrong with me lately!’ and then go ohhhh yeah, I remember, clinically diagnosed depression",1
"I hate, loathe, detest, and abhor myself. I am consumed with guilt, shame, rage, sadness, despair, hopelessness. all of this is reasonable and to be expected, considering my life. my actions. what I do to people.

crazy part is the worst is to come. the darkness will be bad. 

truly alone",1
I just can’t be on my own. I am having suicidal thoughts again.,1
"this weekend has been eye-opening to me in different ways, but i think that in becoming more aware of myself and my problems i'm able to connect with people more. i still struggle with not wanting to be a burden to others even when i really need the help tho it's not something that comes easy to me.",1
"I'm also trying SO HARD to be okay lmao 

I'm going thru it but I'll be fine eventually",1
"1/3

"It mentally drains my happiness to where I feel like if I disappeared, no one would notice or worry about me. I tend to worry about people too and it just makes me wonder what I should even do. I don't even know if i want to continue this.",1
"TW: Suicide



The depression is bad tonight. I'm getting suicidal thoughts - the feeing that I can't do anything right, I'm wrong about everything, I can't even look after Marmite properly. It's all shit.",1
having a lot of pain so i'm going to have to stop drawing for the night because i can't sit up at all. trying not to feel frustrated because it's not like i didn't get anything done today. i just didn't get as much done as i'd hoped to. ah well.,1
"I'm basically non-functional without adderall (not to mention how it helps my anxiety) and my depression is... manageable with an SSRI. 

I've struggled hard with suicidal thoughts and self-harming and for the first time I'm not okay but I'm better than I was. 

Fuck this fucking ghoul.",1
"I may or may not be having depressive thoughts for a while now
And figuring it out feels kinda shitty tbh
Wouldn't wish on anybody to feel like shit on the days leading to their dream surgery :<",1
I wanna die but also i want to live,1
