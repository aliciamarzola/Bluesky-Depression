Verse 1)
Down in the heart of Dixie, there's a boy named Brandon,
With eyes as blue as the summer sky, he's my rock, my mountain.
We met down at the diner, where baguettes and croissants are sold,
He ordered me a coffee, said ""You're prettier than gold.""

(Chorus)
Oh Brandon, you're my southern breeze,
You light up my world, put my mind at ease.
But why do you hate me Nancy? It's a mystery,
'Cause you aren't running for the pope, you're just being free.

(Verse 2)
We danced under the stars, on that old country road,
With fireflies as our spotlight, our love story unfolded.
But Nancy from the trailer park, she's got her eyes on you,
She whispers lies and rumors, trying to break us in two.

(Chorus)
Oh Brandon, you're my guiding light,
In this world full of darkness, you make everything right.
But why do you hate me Nancy? It's hard to see,
You aren't running for the pope, you're just being free.

(Bridge)

Scientists identify neoantigens, abnormal proteins produced by cancer cells.

They take a sample of the patient's mutated cancer cells.

The neoantigens are used to create a vaccine tailored to the patient's tumor.

The vaccine is administered, prompting the immune system to target the cancer cells with those proteins.

The immune system's T-cells attack and destroy the tumor cells, shrinking the cancer.

Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient's tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase l trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCTO2950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage Ill or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine.
At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T-cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T-cell clones. Moreover, T-cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients.
Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.","2000","1299","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:llgfbjvsqkaicezsf7mzjxr3/bafkreia74aeefzoptqpmi4kkdpogdrxfo64gexdhnwub3ru2w7kh7grk3e@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:llgfbjvsqkaicezsf7mzjxr3/bafkreia74aeefzoptqpmi4kkdpogdrxfo64gexdhnwub3ru2w7kh7grk3e@jpeg","This study involved a large and collaborative team across multiple institutions, with key leadership from co-senior authors Toni Choueiri, Derin Keskin, Patrick Ott, and Catherine Wu from DFCI.

Antiracism as Inclusivity: The Racial Justice Paradigm of White Progressive Churches

GERARDO MARTÍ
Department of Sociology
Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina, USA

Observations in White progressive churches across the United States and Canada reveal antiracism as grounded in a ""theology of inclusivity"" framed by a Golden Rule morality. In attempting to integrate antiracism with broader inclusionary initiatives, historically focused on LGBTQ+ affirmation, leaders and members view racism as a ""deeper"" issue, rooted in Christianity's historical complicity and pervasive social injustice. Although antiracism programming fosters dialogue and reflection, the emphasis on inclusivity often stalls in abstraction amid disagree-ment, delaying substantive congregational decisions. The burden of consensus creates an ""awareness trap"" where continuous deliberation replaces decisive action. While forging shared priorities, the antiracism focus prods members toward an individualized ethic, encouraging members to address racial justice through personal roles outside the church beyond any collective congregational efforts. In the process, progressive congregations increasingly reframe individual antiracist initiatives as ecclesial action, allowing churches to view any member efforts as valid extensions of their antiracist identity.

Keywords: antiracism, congregations, liberal Christianity, progressive Christianity, racial justice, race, White-
ness.

The author, Ally, expresses frustration with the high cost of living, particularly for essential services like nursing homes, daycare, and college. 

She points out the irony of expensive nursing homes bankrupting grandparents while nursing home aides rely on food banks. Similarly, daycare costs burden families while providers struggle to make ends meet.  The post concludes by lamenting the high cost of everything, questioning why the money we pay for services doesn't go to the people who actually provide them. The post has garnered significant engagement, with thousands of likes and retweets, suggesting a widespread shared sentiment of frustration and unease with the current economic realities.

All day she says she is sad and feels like crying and she bearly acknowledges me. Come bed time she wants to talk about it and basically gives me a tongue lashing about how I shouldn't have spent that much and she'd rathered me spend it on dinner or other things than the gift.

He and is girlfriend celebrated their 10th anniversary and he is not interested in marriage. I'm willing to guess he thinks that the ""eternal"" roses are a suitable substitute for an engagement ring and the girlfriend is sad /upset about that. I'm guessing he either hasn't had that difficult conversation with her or honestly thinks this shows commitment just as much, but never talked to her about it. I hate when people intentionally mislead people to get validation. Not only are they not married, he had another comment that said fiance and then said he didn't care about marriage.

He sighs and lets the whole thing sink in, watches Stede pick a cranberry out of his muffin, then another one, then inspect it for any other fruity little offenders before eating the chunk.
Something clicks. He frowns. “Stede.”
Stede looks up at him in question, already digging a chunk of dried cranberry out of his next bite. Ed sweeps his tongue across his lips and takes a wild guess at what’s happening over there, based purely on everything he’s coming to understand about this man.
“D’you… hate cranberries?”
Stede pauses, looks guiltily at his little red pile of them. “A bit.”
For god’s sake. “Why the fuck did you choose the cranberry muffin if you hate cranberries?”
Stede frowns. “Well, I thought—I thought maybe I could get myself to like it this time? And I wanted to leave you the best ones.”
“You brought eight different kinds of muffins, man.”
“It’s not that bad.” Stede grimaces as he digs out a particularly large cranberry.
“Stede, oh my god, stop eating the fucking muffin. What do you want instead?”
Instantly, Stede shakes his head and shrugs dismissively. “Oh—really, Ed, I’m fine with this, I—”
“For god’s—Stede.” He leans forward, grabs the bag, and begins pulling out the remaining muffins, one by one, lining them all up on the coffee table. Lemon poppyseed, blueberry, chocolate, whole nine fuckin’ yards. “Come on, just like yesterday. Whatever feels right. Whatever’s gonna make you happy.”","2000","1060","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cibf2qimcyclaybflw5jhzfj/bafkreihbwbqgvy5q365poyrm4brr6f7xx42uxr6zjogh54b6orvt65uly4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cibf2qimcyclaybflw5jhzfj/bafkreihbwbqgvy5q365poyrm4brr6f7xx42uxr6zjogh54b6orvt65uly4@jpeg","Stede scans down the little army of muffins suddenly bearing down on him, looking briefly paralyzed by choice. Ed watches his eyes settle, finally, on the chocolate one.
“Take it.”
Stede looks mortified. “But I—I already took one. And you like chocolate.”
“Yep, sure do. But that one’s yours. Go on.”
Stede hesitates, reaches out, draws his hand back like the muffin might produce a spear and skewer him alive, and then finally picks it up. He stares at it in wonder, then looks back at the complicated cranberry mess he’d originally opted for.
“Ed, why—oh my god, why didn’t I just pick the chocolate muffin?” 
Ed feels like he can hear his world turning on its axis in real time.
He smiles, soft and a little proud. “Dunno, mate. But you picked it now. Better late than never.”
He watches Stede peel down the muffin liner, let out a sigh that sounds honest-to-god like yearning, and take a bite out of that chocolate muffin like he’s letting himself into heaven for the first time.
“Oh,” Stede moans instantly, raising a hand over his mouth as he chews. “Oh, my god, that’s good.”
Once again, Ed would love, simply fucking love, not to be so fucking attracted to this man while he’s having an identity crisis on his sofa. Would help a lot if Stede didn’t moan like he’s making an adult film every time he eats something delicious. Ed schools his response into a fond chuckle that hopefully doesn’t betray the heat suddenly swooping down through his insides.","1999","1064","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cibf2qimcyclaybflw5jhzfj/bafkreieyxucfdpnnv4h3hfwlgkhlzteommfv4ar5zkdrdz7qoucxqicb2a@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cibf2qimcyclaybflw5jhzfj/bafkreieyxucfdpnnv4h3hfwlgkhlzteommfv4ar5zkdrdz7qoucxqicb2a@jpeg","Stede pauses after a beat, mouth still full, gaze falling to the chocolate muffin like it’s just said something fascinating to him. He resumes chewing slowly after a moment, and Ed watches him curiously and sips his coffee, wondering what’s going through that endearing brain this time. Waiting to hear it.
Stede finally swallows, then simply sits there staring at the muffin in his hand. When he speaks, it’s hushed, nearly wavering.
“Ed?”
“Yeah, mate?”
Stede turns to look at him, and there are tears in his eyes. Takes a big, shuddering breath. “I… I think I’m gay.”
Ed breathes into a slow smile. Warm, gentle, absolutely fuckin’ undone with pride. He reaches up to squeeze Stede’s shoulder, then slides the hand across his back to give it a soothing rub. 
“I think that’s fucking fantastic.”
Stede’s next breath is no less shaky, but there’s a hopeful smile on his lips this time. A tender little thing sprouting like a seedling, reaching for the sun through all that ash and chaos. “Yeah?”
“Yeah. Must be one hell of a chocolate muffin.”
That one earns him a real laugh, and Ed is golden, glowing, gone for him.

At the bottom of the cover “a novel” is written in white cursive font, and below that “Kat Dunn” is written in all caps, once again in the bright green color. The majority of the cover is a depiction of a woman lying on her back draped across some sort of settee or couch. Her head and both arms are hanging over the edge of the settee on the left side of the cover. She is wearing a white short sleeve dress with a gold brooch pinned just above her breasts. Her throat and the top of her chest are bared to the light. Her skin is pale except for a blush on the cheek that is turned to the light and a slight pink color in her lips. Her eyes are closed and her mouth is slightly open. Her blonde hair tumbles to the floor. Her arm in the foreground of the picture hangs down so that her knuckles brush against the ground. The cushion of the settee is white although there is a blanket draped over it in colors of gold and pink and red. The rest of the colors surrounding the woman are all warm dark browns and reds. There is a light shining on the red drapes behind the woman and a curiously shaped shadow can be seen blocking part of the light.","1000","667","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:7vc5ejr4ekmfkt2imcofyv3k/bafkreidm5k7h6sfly2rksxtnysi2o5yvviwdtqcjlbi4tn4ovraomm56ma@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:7vc5ejr4ekmfkt2imcofyv3k/bafkreidm5k7h6sfly2rksxtnysi2o5yvviwdtqcjlbi4tn4ovraomm56ma@jpeg","A meme in two panels.

SUCCESS! He doesn't kiss you back-but he doesn't pull away.



Jungkook freezes as he feels Yoongi's mouth against his. There's so much, all at once, and Jungkook doesn't register it before it's too late and Yoongi is pulling away, a soft click of their lips that follows in the deafening silence, except Seoul living on around them. Jungkook's blood thumps in his ears.","1768","924","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:wz4ofmkw22xrtxpkuodd5gab/bafkreid3yl3svma525k66cqc65o5afmtzskg3phverkh4tlnej4jubu4fm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:wz4ofmkw22xrtxpkuodd5gab/bafkreid3yl3svma525k66cqc65o5afmtzskg3phverkh4tlnej4jubu4fm@jpeg","""See, not a coward,"" Yoongi whispers, and his breath still reaches Jungkook, how close they are to each other. Jungkook wants to pull in and kiss him this time, but it's as if there's an invisible wall between what he wants to do and what he can do, and kissing Yoongi back is not the option.

And then Yoongi shakes his head, his fingers rubbing at his eyes tiredly.

""I've just cheated, I think,"" Yoongi says. ""I don't think it was the right time.""

Jungkook immediately feels mad, because no, the one who has just cheated is him, unless there's someone else in Yoongi's life too who he entertains between annoying Jungkook and working on the game. And yes, it was terrible timing.

""Wait. It wasn't the right time, but I still did it. Save-scumming-"" Yoongi's eyes widen. ""Oh my god, I should add something to the game to prevent save-scumming, I completely forgot about that.""

Jungkook realises that Yoongi is not talking about infidelity. He's talking about game cheating. He's talking about duping. Some weird save-scumming.

Jungkook takes an angry step back. ""I was right. The game is the only thing you ever think about.""","1611","924","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:wz4ofmkw22xrtxpkuodd5gab/bafkreihp5xkaqigfk35ri5k77a36bkatm7cmhgad2gddsvfdxlfjax6q5i@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:wz4ofmkw22xrtxpkuodd5gab/bafkreihp5xkaqigfk35ri5k77a36bkatm7cmhgad2gddsvfdxlfjax6q5i@jpeg","Yoongi looks at him for another long second, his head tilted. Then it's as if he comes back to Earth, harshly falling back, and he blinks at Jungkook, the haze leaving his eyes.

He takes the step forward that Jungkook has taken away from him, shortening the distance between them again. He takes Jungkook's chin. Like another wrong second and he's going to pull Jungkook in and kiss him again.

Jungkook's chest is so empty and buzzing, small bundles of nerves contracting as he locks eyes with Yoongi, waiting.
But then Yoongi only caresses Jungkook's chin with his thumb, this spot under his bottom lip.

""Tell your boyfriend I said hi."" And then Yoongi pulls away and turns around and walks away, and Jungkook has to watch his back and his figure getting further and further away down the street, like a boringly heartbreaking cutscene that you can't skip and hate the game developers for that.

Now, Astarion finally turned to acknowledge Frans, a look of absolute disinterest on his pale face as he spoke. ""I do so wish I knew what you were saying, Frans my boy but I don't speak inbred mongrel.""

Frans goes still, breathing in and out slowly as he tried to focus on not blowing up in front of everyone but he was dangling at the end of his rope.

""Now, you can either stop barking incessantly and educate yourself on proper etiquette and sophisticated idiolect or sit back down and stay mute as I'm sure your master taught you,"" Astarion's words were like a snake, slithering off of his tongue and dripping with venom. 

Frans licked his lips and tapped his toes as he looked away. So much was going through his head right now, blurring together and making everything unfocused by swirls of anxiety, fear, grief, and anger. After a few long moments of silence, he simply raises a finger, gives it a swirl before making a zipping motion over his mouth, smiling the whole time. Next came an over exaggerated gesture with both arms as he took a little bow as if to ask if Astarion was pleased now. It all was rather sarcastic. 

Gale glanced over at his lover and grew even more concerned. The last time he snapped like this, he mutilated a nurse and it was a side of Frans that only showed up when he was extremely pissed. 

Like now. 

""That's better,"" Astarion stuck his nose up as he turned back to his drink, clearly done with this conversation and wanting to be left alone to stew.

However, he could feel the burning sensation of eyes burrowing into the back of his head seconds before he felt someone grab his hair and yank, pulling him right off of the stool and to the ground.

""For the love of...."" Astarion started to growl but Frans quickly shut him up with a swift punch to the jaw. 

After rubbing his sore jaw, Astarion looked up at Frans who simply glared down at him, not saying a word. 

","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreib34xd5y4ydl5tvozeaaltgnrpwd4jj3igvn3bnmmiqbpffm6rylm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreib34xd5y4ydl5tvozeaaltgnrpwd4jj3igvn3bnmmiqbpffm6rylm@jpeg","Frans was taking off his swords and throwing them to the side as he gave Astarion a moment to get to his feet but that was the only reprieve as he stepped forth and slugged the older man again, causing the other to stumble back a few steps.

Astarion steadied himself and then takes a moment to wipe away the faintest trail of blood leaking from his nose. As he licked the crimson stain from his thumb, he gave Frans a dangerous, almost predatory look as the thought of draining him dry and being done with it but he refrains, knowing it would do more harm than good. And besides, he didn't really want the young man dead. No. All he wanted was to be left alone to deal with this mess on his own.

Sadly, there was no going back at this point and there were far too many differences to settle before they could keep going.

In the blink of an eye the distance between them was crossed, the gap sealed as Frans rushed forward, swinging another punch that hit Astarion square in the face again and without giving the vampire a breather this time, he brings his knee up to strike him right in the gut. The wind was knocked out of the latter and he narrowly stepped out of the way of another hit. It was his turn to retaliate.

In one swift motion, Astarion side steps Frans and fluidly brings his hand down to grab the young rogue's side, right where he had been slashed.  His clawed fingers dig into the raw flesh, breaking through the dried blood and spilling a fresh stream onto the floor as he burrowed deep.

Frans let out a gasp but manages to hold back a shout as he grits his teeth. He makes an attempt to collect himself and strike back but Astarion caught the swing this time and twists the wrist within his grasp, causing sharp pain to shoot up the appendage. Unfortunately for one of them, the vampire spawn was the only one who came out of their previous battle in better shape and he also had his heightened abilities, so it was looking to be in his favor at the moment. 

","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreidyvmlfr5pdrxvqbjbpqnpuu25iyxv6ofzvaonvl5eh76ivzsbspm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreidyvmlfr5pdrxvqbjbpqnpuu25iyxv6ofzvaonvl5eh76ivzsbspm@jpeg","With the tables now turned, Astarion lets out an animalist growl as he plunges his fingers in deeper, finally getting a pained yelp out of Frans who was trying to wiggle free but failing.

""Do not test me, boy,"" Astarion snarled as he pulled Frans close, getting right in his face. ""A rapid mutt deserves to be put down.""

Frans flared his nostrils and pursed his lips angrily but wastes no time in throwing his head back and bringing it forward with full force. As his forehead makes contact, he could feel Astarion's nose crack from the impact. The pressure on his side instantly vanishes and he stumbles back, breathing heavily as he sucks in air to combat the blazing pain. As he looked back at Astarion, he was still seeing red but from the blood dripping down his face this time. 

Astarion was silent for a moment, registering what just happenee before looking at Frans with both befuddlement and rage. ""You fucking little cunt!""

""Foehckin kess me arse, ya fanged bastard!"" Frans retorted back with just as much venom. ""I might be a dahg boeht you're a coward and a useless foehck who's ahnly good fahr a good snahg. Get bent!""

""Oh, that's rich coming from you,"" Astarion retorted back, cackling dryly. ""I don't have a choice who's penis I put in my mouth. Your mother on the other hand? I can only imagine how many she begged to stroke.""

Now, Astarion was just being nasty, fighting with his words to trip Frans up where he knew the young lad felt the most. It did the trick though and Frans lunged at him, ready to strangle the other man with his bare hands if he had to. But he misses as the former sidesteps and causes him to stumble and nearly lose balance.

The smirk pulling at Astarion's lips was cruel and cold as he stepped away, crimson gaze following Frans as he continueed to taunt him. ","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreiflpbz7hyshxbvzaskxiqw726ab4demupco24spwxkbmffb2762ua@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:za5ly43gntmln4dqqxjjqvc4/bafkreiflpbz7hyshxbvzaskxiqw726ab4demupco24spwxkbmffb2762ua@jpeg","""You know, that reminds me of this stray cat that used to live outside of my room growing up. She was always in heat. Gods know how many filthy kittens she had that never made it. Now..."" his smirk grew, fangs glistening with the scarlet sheen of his own blood. ""I wonder how many babies your mother dumped before you?""

That was the last straw.

Frans was going to kill him.

This time when rushing him, Frans finally made contact, tackling Astarion to the ground. A few good hits were landed that would surely leave deep bruises and minor lacerations, on both the vampire face and the half-elf's knuckles. For a moment Astarion's vision blurred and his ears rang with each impact, dazing him which allowed Frans to break his nose once again. A few intense healing spells would be needed to realign it after this.

""Dahn't! Foehckin! Bring! Me! Moehm! Into! Dis!"" Frans was practically shouting now, pissed beyond reason. In fact, he was so angry, tears pricking at the corners of his eyes were now rolling down his cheeks. Intrusive thoughts fueled by rage took over and he stopped swinging, instead wrapping his hands around Astarion's neck and squeezing as hard as he could. ""Ya can talk shet abooeht me all you want boeht leave me moehm ooeht o' yooehr felthy, lyin mooehth!""

Astarion gagged, choking on the air as his windpipe was forcfulily closed. Thankfully, he didn't require much air if at all but the act did throw him off and out of bodily reflex, he started to claw at Frans's hands.

""Dahn't you foehckin dare! She was a lahvin wahman who cared! Ya dahn't get to say shet abooeht 'er! Naht when yer a selfesh, oehncarin peg! Aku's foehckin dyin and ya dahn't even give a shet! Ya dahn't get to say a damn foehckin din, ya 'ere me! Shoeht oehp!"" Frans was livid, spitting as he screamed at Astarion, telling him off as he straddled him.

We do so as artists, activists, musicians, and people who place themselves in the strong anti-racist tradition that formed punk and which keeps it relevant today.This is a legacy you yourselves should be completely aware of. When you first formed in Los Angeles in the ’80s, it was the experimental, fluid moment that the punk scene was going through at the time that gave you the space you needed to take on a new sound, mixing elements of funk and other styles into your music. This was a scene noted for being uniquely multiracial, the scene that gave rise to Fishbone and Suicidal Tendencies; not to mention Fear, so important to the early formation of hardcore punk, a band that you, Flea, played the bass for! You even had Gang of Four’s Andy Gill produce one of your albums, and DH Peligro–originally of Dead Kennedys fame–ended up replacing Jack Irons on the drums.So what’s the rub? Well, while some in the mainstream may have forgotten this history–scratching their heads at why a bunch of no-good punks would  bother with a band as commercial as RHCP–we have not, and we intend to remind you and your fans of these roots.","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreie7yiypguil76hubkvodbq442coid7qg57ie6sy2v53n4tweshpwi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreie7yiypguil76hubkvodbq442coid7qg57ie6sy2v53n4tweshpwi@jpeg","Because your proximity to punk as a band should have put you in touch with the best tendencies of rebel music, of music as a form of resistant community–and that is something to be cherished, not to be rejected by playing in Israel. By doing so, you would be, in the words of the Israeli group Boycott from Within, serving “the government’s agenda of whitewashing its war crimes and creating an image of Israel as a “modern state”.It is for this reason that we were saddened and disappointed to hear of your announced show in Israel. We would have thought that RHCP would be aware of the pressing issues of racism and war in today’s world, something no one–especially punks–could miss. We would have thought that your experience in the scene that catapulted you to fame, a scene known for its strong principles and solidarity with struggles worldwide, would have been aware that Israel’s intention in making such a big deal about your gig is part of a cool, calculating game to cover up its crimes against Palestinians.We would have thought that you would have done your homework, and found out that, after their forced removal from the majority of Palestine in 1948, Palestinians have been living under occupation by the Israeli military for over 40 years now.","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreib4fii7ligkvg2vbme4nfsduisytwxnsdojazchfrdvtqkmbu5rie@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreib4fii7ligkvg2vbme4nfsduisytwxnsdojazchfrdvtqkmbu5rie@jpeg","We would have thought that you would have wanted to learn, before playing right into the Israeli state’s hands, that Palestinians live in segregated spaces all across the West Bank and in the open-air prison of the Gaza Strip, and that the apartheid-like laws of the Israeli state make it so that even a Palestinian fan who *wanted* to come to your show would be almost guaranteed to be turned down, as some were very recently on their way to Madonna’s concert in Ramat Gan. We would have expected you to be appalled and disgusted, as artists but more importantly as human beings, by the shallow exploitation of art and entertainment such as yours to somehow justify some of the most despicable acts of inhumanity against a people in resistance for their basic civil rights and for liberation.Maybe you never had the same political leanings as your fellow punks–but make no mistake, your decision to play is political, just as much as your decision not to play would be. We are asking you to honor the global boycott launched by Palestinian civil society in 2005 as a non-violent means to achieve their basic human rights. Refuse to play in Israel, like many other musicians from Roger Waters, to Devendra Banhart, Macy Gray, and Elvis Costello (to name a few), and join a growing movement of artists who, like in the era of South African apartheid, say “I Ain’t Gonna Play!”.","1080","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreihh34wgixxk5h2njlaqfhrcdgncej62yad5rfy6lk2w4i5owxuybu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreihh34wgixxk5h2njlaqfhrcdgncej62yad5rfy6lk2w4i5owxuybu@jpeg","en",,,"4",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:45qqoowxslhmau7l5rmhycl4/bafkreif6ksrxe3bzhcyq7xubsq4aebfjqfme2tcrdsbneabb6js44d4vdm@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal","1","0","(03/11/24 IG Repost)

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement), cursed
“A simple silver pendant with a ruby rose colored gem shaped like two hearts overlapping one another.”
While attuned to this magic item you gain advantage on Charisma (persuasion) and Charisma (deception) skill checks.

You can use an action to attempt to charm one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. They must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 hour. The charmed target obeys your spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from you or another creature or receives a suicidal command from you, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the necklace of lust for the next 24 hours. Once you successfully use this ability you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

Curse of Lust. If a creature succeeds in resisting the charm...",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:h2fsxstbx4k7umz4jai6jwdz/bafkreieyvn72hrotvpvcvaq3lb2ykmjfwqy2kne2lcwvenxz7rtadqj5fy@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:h2fsxstbx4k7umz4jai6jwdz/bafkreieyvn72hrotvpvcvaq3lb2ykmjfwqy2kne2lcwvenxz7rtadqj5fy@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"0",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:h2fsxstbx4k7umz4jai6jwdz/bafkreieyvn72hrotvpvcvaq3lb2ykmjfwqy2kne2lcwvenxz7rtadqj5fy@jpeg?f=.jpeg","suicidal","0","0","Next up in our line of the 7 Deadly Sin DnD items is the Lust Necklace!

In one hand, he's clutching his ""I quack myself up"" mug, which is full of hot coffee. His eyes are wide and bloodshot as he stares off into the distance, and his hair is a mess.

Alastor: (thinking to himself) Well this is... concerning.
Lucifer: (blearily) ....wuh?

- has been trying to get his attention for the past 15 minutes
- just finished his late night radio show

A few blurbs on Lucifer:
- fighting off a depressive episode

Seine Gegner: ""die Kröte"" Franz Josef Strauß und - an Stelle des Jokers - ""der Waigel"".

He was painfully aware it was getting dark, far later than he’d expected to get out of the latest fucking appearance he’d had to put on as Blackbeard. Exhaustion made it hard to act normal, his temper frayed a little as he turned a corner. Tomorrow was the big show for Blackbeard, invites had been sent, everything set up and Ed felt as though he were on his last nerve.
The past few days had been a blur of two pieces of himself. His time spent donning the role of Blackbeard, the same shit, the same conversations, the same god damn exhausting parties. The rest spent as Ed, just Ed, with Stede and his little crew, racing between roles and covering it up. 
Hannah Montana needs new writers, this is fuckin’ exhausting. He thought wearily and rubbed his face, glancing at a window to be sure the black eye paint was gone. 
Ed knew he was playing a dangerous game. There was no denying it. He knew logically that he couldn’t date Stede. For one, fuck, he was a wreck, he knew that. He was a ball of god damn problems that had all been wrapped up in a neat little package named “Edward Teach: Do Not Approach.” It was a sign that Stede should have listened to, but the alpha didn’t see it, the alpha only saw Ed. Somehow, he just saw fucking Edward. He smiled at Ed, beamed and laughed with Ed, ran through the streets hand in hand with Edward Mother Fucking Teach. And Ed couldn’t push him away.

It was a slap in the face, the backwards thinking found in France, and so many other countries. It had been a coup to take the Swede from Low, but also he knew the fucker well enough to know he was dangerous. He knew the claiming laws on the books in France, he wasn’t above using a bit of threat and blackmail to keep the Swede under his thumb. No, Lars was better with the Queen Anne, all of them were. Well, hopefully better, the omega seemed a little off his rocker.
I should end it with Stede, right? I can’t date him. Fuck, what do I say? He felt a twist in his gut. He wouldn’t betray me if he knew, right? He’s not that way.
And then what? He couldn’t exactly date the alpha that publicly, he’d still have to be Blackbeard. He’d still have to perform like a fucking circus monkey for the crowds. They could have a relationship that was mostly built on lies and secrets, even if Stede knew. And, fuck, Ed could hide his scent, but Stede was an alpha, which was harder to hide day to day. What would people say if they picked up the whiff of another alpha on Blackbeard? Omega scents could be covered or excused, they were light and soft, Stede’s scent was meant to be picked up.
Deservedly so. Ed thought wistfully, unable to keep a small smile from himself as he thought about the rich spiced brandy and marmalade.

He hadn’t had much of a taste since the alpha preferred to wear scent patches, but still, he wouldn’t mind waking up with that scent mixed in his nest. 
Ed paused and blinked. The fuck did that thought come from? He didn’t take people to his nest. He gave himself a shake as he walked into the design room, trying to get his exhaustion fogged mind to wake up. His eyes instantly went to where Stede should have been, but the spot was empty except for his assistant. The model was being adjusted as the young alpha adjusted the outfit and took a few pictures.
“Stede around?” Ed glanced about, grinning to see the Swede already in a corner as if he’d always been there. God, Low was gonna be pissed and Ed was gonna enjoy every fucking minute.
“He’s on a call with his ex-wife.” Lucius glanced up and narrowed his eyes before crinkling his nose. “God, did you fall on an alpha or something?”
“Ugh, is it that bad?” Ed sniffed himself. He had worn the faux-alpha scent so long he sometimes didn’t pay attention to it. “Been workin’ all day.”
“Uh, yeah, bad like you rolled all over him.” Lucius straightened up and gave the model a little pat. “Go ahead and take this off, we’ll get it taken in a smidge.”

He had done it again.  He had seen Ed looking at the skirt and made assumptions and then he had gone ahead and gotten him to try it on. And after that, when Ed had said he wasn’t comfortable, Stede had sent him that picture.  What had he been thinking?!  What sort of alpha dressed in an outfit like that?  
He could only imagine the omega in there trying to find a way to leave politely without hurting Stede’s feelings.   Stede should have growled and told him he was sexy, gotten possessive and dominating, right?  That’s what alphas were supposed to do with an omega, show them they were desired, not throw them in a changing room with a skirt, then basically confess to crossdressing.  God, he should have put Mary on speed-dial, he should have some sort of person on a mic in his ear to stop making these stupid choices.
“Ed?” Stede called softly and tried to sound like he wasn’t falling into a pit of panic.  “Did you look?”
Of course he didn’t, you idiot, he obviously didn’t want to and you went and made it weird.  He told himself bitterly as there was movement on the other side of the door.
He nearly fell into the changing room as the door swung inwards and Stede only caught himself at the last minute.

“Ed.” He rasped out as the omega gave him a look, dark eyes going darker while Stede stared.  He knew he was staring, running his eyes up and down Ed in a manner that no gentleman should have used.
“Alpha.” Ed’s voice was a low purr and Stede felt that tone go straight to his cock.
Not a gentleman, I am not a gentleman… He thought before one of Ed’s hands reached out to catch his tie and twisted his fist around it.
“You look… Ed, you’re gorgeous in that, st-stunning… and… oh god… “  Stede gasped as the tie was used like a leash, dragging him into the room and Ed’s hand reached up to slide into his short hair.
“That corset, mate, that fuckin’ corset.”  Ed’s words were rich and seductive before Stede found his head tipped up to the tall omega.  “That skirt.”
“You liked—rrrmmm…”  Stede’s words were lost as Ed’s lips claimed his in a searing kiss.
Stede tipped his head up into the kiss, his hands reached out to press to either side of the soft skirt, sliding upwards as Ed’s tongue darted out.

Ed kissed as if he were drowning, memorizing the pattern of Stede’s tongue and lips, the purr broke free in a rapturous burst that the alpha swallowed down.  The world was an explosion of scent, sweet pineapple and coconut, exotic and making Stede’s breath deepen as he moved a hand to wrap around Ed’s waist.  He felt the warm solid weight, the arch into his touch.
He forgot they were in public as Ed’s kiss deepened and their tongues chased each other.  He shifted his weight while Ed slotted himself forward, every inch pressed against Stede until he felt the sweep of the skirt dragging along his pants legs.  He forgot about being a gentleman as Ed’s leg slotted forward, pressing between his thighs as if the omega were bound and determined to get as close as possible.
It was only a need to breathe that eventually made him gasp out, a ragged burst of air as Ed pulled back.  His whiskey brown eyes were dark, intense, hovering so close to Stede’s as their lips barely ghosted one another.  Stede knew his scent had gone sharper, spiced with cinnamon, he couldn’t stop it as he felt the slide of a long-fingered hand gliding along his side, through his hair.
“Omega.”  Stede purred low in his throat, reaching up to brush a thumb along one elegant cheek bone.  “You wear fine things well.”","766","537","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ce6sp5vz574grawhp63mlemz/bafkreihwaoday4emzpxtbmvipltladapk7kenm7kjp5zow4pzpa46unoxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ce6sp5vz574grawhp63mlemz/bafkreihwaoday4emzpxtbmvipltladapk7kenm7kjp5zow4pzpa46unoxq@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"45",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ce6sp5vz574grawhp63mlemz/bafkreiag3dkyp6w56gspjf2vhedtsqtdoomc2gzmwzl3ohx3srmjjp2zni@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","6","0","113.

He knew how to fucking get dressed for events like that.  He had an entire wardrobe for that shit packed up in his hotel room.  What he wasn’t used to was going out with a group of people casually to a bar he’d gone to ten years ago and remembered as being fun, relaxed.  What he wasn’t used to was the casual fucking assumption that he was invited and welcome.
He began with some of the low-level Blackbeard shit, but it was just dragging on another costume.  He didn’t want to be Blackbeard, he wanted to be Ed.  Ed and Stede.  A nice ring to it, really, so he dragged out outfits wildly, sorting through in an attempt to figure out what would go well at the club.  He’d picked it out after Stede had confessed that he didn’t want to go to any of the more popular alpha-clubs.  Locations that were mostly used for hook-ups, dominance games, and places omegas and betas went for a bit of fun.  Paris was ripe with them, it normally was, but the Sapphire Moon was low-key, artsy.
You’re a fuckin’ world famous designer, you can make up a god damn outfit.  He told himself in frustration as he ended up with clothes all over his suite.
In the end, he went for something that was a bit of a mix.  The soft turtleneck was black, but the fabric was decadently fine and it was a joy to wear against his skin. He loved fine fabrics, the caress of them, making him think of soft nesting material.

It was Blackbeard’s signature colors, but that was to be expected if he was going to show up and tell them he was…
Fuck, I guess Blackbeard’s PA?  Somethin’ fuckin’ vague.  He thought before dragging on well worn leather pants to match the top.
They were old, worn to fit him like a second skin, wonderfully comforting and he even found a thigh harness to wrap around one upper leg and attach to a wide belt.  It worked perfectly, made him look a little edgy, but hopefully far away from the extravagant fucking leather coat and studs that Blackbeard wore.  No eye makeup, but he paired it with a long trail of earrings and a silver choker around his throat.  Once his long hair was pulled up into a bun to mask the length, Ed looked at himself in the mirror and smirked.  
You’re not dressing to impress Stede, you’re just going out for drinks.  With a group.  Odd, that the group part thrilled him too.  Fuck, you’re a sad sack, excited for drinks with strangers.

It sort of goes along with the old adage, ""Don't cry over spilled milk."" The thing is done, you can't go back and undo it, so you had better figure out how you're going to clean up the mess.

And you will sometimes, in the course of cleaning up messes, make mistakes. You will also encounter opposition from others who complain that you're not cleaning it up the right way, or quickly enough, or whatever. It's important to realize that such comments are useless. The way to fix things is not to sit around discussing the perfect plan of action and figure out exactly how to return everything to its precise pre-mess state; you have to work quickly to stop the mess from spreading, then clean up the bulk of it, and then you can get into the minutiae.

At best, he felt as though he was loosely tolerated, perhaps even affectionately, but there was always the feeling that he had to work for it.  Nearly every connection he had ever made had been a battle.  With Ed, it had been easy.  Almost alarmingly easy.  The omega had grinned at him and giggled, laughing at his jokes about fishing nets and fabric battles.
“I made a friend, can we just leave it at that?”  Stede sighed after the fifth round of interrogation.  “I can have friends.”
“Yeah, you can, but I also know that this industry is cutthroat and I don’t want you to end up getting in trouble.”  Lucius pointed out and set his work aside.

“I’ve begged you to stop sending me text updates about your ‘social life’, you mean.”  Stede growled affectionately and gave his head a shake.
Ed had said they’d meet again tonight, would they?  Stede nervously began to erase some lines and add others while Lucius tried to wheedle more out of him.  He wasn’t going to cave, not this time.  He didn’t want to gossip, he just wanted to enjoy an evening where he hadn’t felt wrong-footed around someone.  Where he’d laughed so hard that his cheeks had begun to hurt near the end and he’d gone to sleep with a smile.
If he told Lucius he’d spent the evening with an omega that had been dressed in a pair of pajama pants and a banyan, he was sure things would get crossed.  Not that Ed wasn’t… Stede swallowed and knew that his cheeks were heating as he thought about the elegant, tattooed omega.  The sweet scent of pineapple and coconut that had made Stede want to croon.  Fine, alright, Ed was lovely, breath-taking, but it wasn’t his secondary gender that made Stede enjoy his company.

The banter and laughter, flinging fabric around like snowballs, it had been a lovely interlude.
“Oh shit, there he is.”  Lucius hissed out and Stede’s eyes snapped up.  He was so lost in his thoughts that he immediately looked for Ed.
Instead, he saw the imposing leather-clad Blackbeard striding down the hall with the short, rather irritating, Izzy Hands dogging his heels.  He was unmistakable with a thick beard that hung down to his chest and his heavy hair loose around his head like a lion’s mane.  The black-on-black leather had points of steel that caught the light as he swept past the rooms that went a bit quiet in his wake.
Stede had only seen him a handful of times, each time there was the same reaction, people seemed to stare at him.  He rarely glanced at him, he moved like a ship at full sail, cutting through the waves and leaving behind the burning scent of gun powder and sea salt.  An alpha’s alpha through and through.
“Oh, it’s just Blackbeard.”  Stede sighed and that earned a look from Lucius.
“Okay, no, you’re telling me literally everything about whoever you met last night.”  Lucius demanded sharply as Stede went back to his work rather than stare at Blackbeard.  The man was their employer, not some zoo exhibit, it was impolite to gawk.

""I have known Elon Musk at a deep level for 14 years, well before he was a household name. We used to text frequently. He would come to my birthday party and invite me to his parties. He would tell me everything about his women problems. As sons of highly accomplished men who married venuses, were violent and lost their fortunes, and who were bullied in high school, we had a number of things in common most people cannot relate to. We would hang out together late in Los Angeles. He would visit my San Diego lab. He invested in my company.

""Elon believes he is above everyone else. He used to think he worked on the most important problems. When I met him, he did not presume to be a technical person — he would be the first to say that he lacked the expertise to understand certain data. That happened later. Now, he acts as if he has all the solutions. 

All his talk about getting to Mars to “maintain the light of consciousness” or about “free speech absolutism” is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far right parties, because they are easier to control. That is also why he gave himself $56 Billion which could have gone to the people actually doing the work and innovations he is taking credit for at Tesla (the reason he does not do patents is because he would not be listed as an inventor as putting a fake inventor on a patent would kill it and moreover it would reveal the superstars behind the work).

""companies and tried to create rivals. I fired him with cause in December 2021 when he tried to undermine NV.

Elon did two Nazi salutes.

He did them for five main reasons: 

1. He was concerned that the “Nazi wing” of the MAGA movement, under the influence of Steve Bannon, would drive him away from Trump, somewhere in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, rather than in the West Wing which is where he wants to be. He was already feeling raw over the fact that Trump did not follow his recommendation for Treasury Secretary and that the Senate also did not pick his first choice;

2. He was upset that he had had to go to Israel and Auschwitz to make up for agreeing with a Nazi sympathizer online and wanted to reclaim his “power” just like when he told advertisers to “go fuck yourself”. This has nothing to do with Asperger’s;

""5. His narcissistic self was hoping the audience would reflect his abject gesture back to him, thereby showing complete control and dominion over it, and increasing his leverage over Trump. That did not happen. 

Bottom line: Elon is not a Nazi but he did give two Nazi Salutes, which is completely unacceptable.

I. My point is that he is transactional rather than ideological;

II.

You look down at your figure, a cute floral sundress that compliments the shining sun and cooling waves coming from the North Blue ocean. Your nails a pretty sea foam blue to compliment your island locale. 

Would he even take it well? Would he still see you as his old drinking buddy and best friend?Or would he hear you out?

Whatever the reason for this change, it must be something important. You finally stop stirring your tea as you go to take a sip. Before the liquid touches your lips you begin to sense something off about your surroundings. As you put your cup back down, you notice no hustle and bustle of the market close by or marines stopping by to inspect the surroundings. The seagulls make no discernible noise even though they obviously are moving their beaks.

Silence. Utter and complete silence, you try to speak but no one seems to hear you in your secluded table of the small cafe. That is when he sits down. 

The immediate form comes into view: A large and gaudy black feather jacket. This is accompanied by a light pink shirt with several red hearts adorning it. Where the center of his chest is lies an opening that reveals his chest, pale but still obviously built. The last feature that sticks out his face. A right eye with spiked blue under eye makeup pairs with an almost clown-like painted smile. A cigarette dangles from his lips, lit and occasionally inhaled.

He stares as you with his hazel brown eyes, looking you up and down, as if he is trying to recognize you. That’s when he pulls from the cigarette yet says nothing. You try to read more of his expression but he seems to hide it well, like a poker player bluffing a bad hand. A few moments pass with no word, and the deafening silence sets in as you still look around with nothing making a sound.

With a click of his tongue, he says, “Wow, it’s interesting to see you like this…” Another drag from his cigarette. 
“Well what is that suppose to mean?” you ask annoyedly. His blunt observation was kind of abrasive. Rosy was always general quiet but kind. Why was he acting this…serious? Did something happen and could it be why he’s going by “Corazon?” 

“So, I got a couple of questions.” He sits with a more relaxed position as he dangles the cigarette back in his mouth. “First, are you happy with your discovery?” ","1913","1242","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreifb6odt5aocfxgibzhbbhvy5i4prn2grsbptdbceyq2r275pvld5q@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreifb6odt5aocfxgibzhbbhvy5i4prn2grsbptdbceyq2r275pvld5q@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"3",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ger5kqhn5llji6gse367orut/bafkreiegoptpxqi74dibqgxw5f4qsijx4o5j5ldy4skp2m6teeuhmnokny@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","1","1","Listen…I have never written fanfic.

For himself, Maritain had some serious regrets: “Having believed for a time in a parallelism of action between the people of the A.F. and the Thomist renaissance is one of the great errors of my life…. I paid very dearly for that error.” “Since then I have undertaken the liquidation of the errors of the past with perseverance.” For himself, Simon returned again and a6in to the figure of Father Garrigou (“a disgusting character”): “If I did not hold the sacerdotal role in such respect I would write to him that I would hold him responsible if some misfortune comes to any of my Jewish friends.” Simon confessed a temptation to hate the Thomist theologian more than Petain, more than Mussolini, more even than Hitler.

I first discovered what was killing these men.
I had three sons who worked with their father in the tunnel:
Cecil, aged 23, Owen, aged 21, Shirley, aged 17.
They used to work in a coal mine, not steady work for the mines were not going much of the time.
A power Co. foreman learned that we made home brew, he formed a habit of dropping in evenings to drink, persuading the boys and my husband— give up their jobs and take this other work.
It would pay them better.
Shirley was my youngest son; the boy.
He went into the tunnel.
My heart my mother my heart my mother
My heart my coming into being.
My husband is not able to work.
He has it, according to the doctor.
We have been having a very hard time making a living since this trouble came to us.
I saw the dust in the bottom of the tub.
The boy worked there about eighteen months, came home one evening with a shortness of breath.
He said, ""Mother, I cannot get my breath.""","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","Shirley was sick about three months.
I would carry him from his bed to the table, from his bed to the porch, in my arms.
My heart is mine in the place of hearts, They gave me back my heart, it lies in me.
When they took sick, right at the start, I saw a doctor.
I tried to get Dr. Harless to X-ray the boys.
He was the only man I had any confidence in, the company doctor in the Kopper's mine, but he would not see Shirley.
He did not know where his money was coming from.
I promised him half if he'd work to get compensation, but even then he would not do anything.
I went on the road and begged the X-ray money, the Charleston hospital made the lung pictures, he took the case after the pictures were made.
And two or three doctors said the same thing.
The youngest boy did not get to go down there with me, he lay and said, ""Mother, when I die, I want you to have them open me up and see if that dust killed me.

I have gained mastery over my heart
I have gained mastery over my two hands I have gained mastery over the waters I have gained mastery over the river.
The case of my son was the first of the line of lawsuits.
They sent the lawyers down and the doctors down; they closed the electric sockets in the camps.
There was Shirley, and Cecil, Jeffrey and Oren, Raymond Johnson, Clev and Oscar Anders, Frank Lynch, Henry Palf, Mr. Pitch, a foreman; a slim fellow who carried steel with my boys, his name was Darnell, I believe. There were many others, the towns of Glen Ferris, Alloy, where the white rock lies, six miles away; Vanetta, Gauley Bridge, Gamoca, Lockwood, the gullies, the whole valley is witness.
I hitchhike eighteen miles, they make checks out.

It feels a little bloated. However, even as it makes reading the book less enjoyable, the level of detail reminds you that these are all individual people, children, with lives and dreams and fears, being tortured and slaughtered, not numbers. In seeing a little of each life, no matter how sparse, we see more fully every death.

In a similar tension, the violence and gore is a bit more brutal than the film, which makes it feel pulpy sometimes — but at other times, it's effective in heightening the dissonance between the glossy, caring facade of what Takami describes as ""successful fascism,"" and the nauseatingly cruel reality of fascism, its calculated yet senseless violence. A fascinating effect when it appears, even if the book largely falls into the category of exploitation pulp, missing a more articulate satire in its lack of subtlety.","1857","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","Maybe the connotations of ""exploitation"" are a bit misleading here, though; there's a palpable anger behind the hyperviolence, not an aim to cash in, at least on the author's part, not that I can sense — a louder, more visceral expression of youth unrest in 90s Japan. Snapshots of what youth become, what they become capable of doing and compelled to do, in such an oppressive world. Takami's 2009 afterword is revealing; he writes that ""the nation that would serve as the setting for the novel was added later,"" but ""Still, I thought that figurative county couldn't be written any differently [...] I wanted to write about the trapped feeling of living in Japan I've felt clearly since childhood — at the very least, from middle school on [...] When I was born, near the end of the '60s, there existed even in Japan the sort of culture where a college student would throw Molotov cocktails at police. But in the '80s, when I was a teenager, that environment had vanished. Maybe everyone became disillusioned when they discovered that even throwing Molotov cocktails at police didn't change anything. This may be related to my feeling of trapped hopelessness.""

Battle Royale was rejected in the final round of the 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, leaving no winner that year; the judges admitted it was the best work, but as judge Mariko Hayashi put it, ""I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this."" The decade preceding its publication was marked by the murder of Junko Furuta and the Kobe child murders, the decade following by Tsutomu Miyazaki's serial murders and the Sasebo slashing —and, in the US, Columbine. It has gone on to become a cult hit globally and shaped popular culture deeply. It spoke (and speaks) to coming of age in an increasingly pressurized world that warps and crushes, of eating or being eaten and finding the strength to choose neither, to keep running.

And, ultimately, I think that that matters more than the prose being amateur, the characters sometimes flat and hamfisted. The roughness is part of that feeling Battle Royale evokes: the raw, juvenile cry for help.","2000","1019","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","en",,,"2",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreidceixvnmoyivcavhp43d3tddpjf73cvteyf3ueztbovkufgcae6y@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I was gone","1","0","📚🌟3️⃣ BATTLE ROYALE 📖 バトル・ロワイアル (remastered ver., koushun takami, 1999 / 2014, tr. nathan collins) www.bookwormreads.co/rubyfire77/s...","https://bsky.app/profile/rubyfire77.bsky.social/post/3lj72tztcq22m"

also its killing me that 江醒道，“我在大瑜待了七年，回到这里也只是一场午觉的时间。” bc it implies that jiang xing just took a damn afternoon nyap where everything happened. BC HE DIDNT. HE FUCKING DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT BY SAVING A PREGNYANT WOMAN😭 i wouldve manyaged to work everything out in my head if not for this part. bc ??? would make more sense if this extra started when jiang xing woke up in a hospital bc he didnt actually die and was just in a coma. idk whats going to happen if/when they go back, bc whats going to happen to the jiang xing in this universe???

Trawling through the land like the fiery smoke that rose from the battlefields.
	Just as Adrestia seemingly set its sights on Leicester, a revelation of the origins of House Riegan’s current heir tore their unity asunder. Claude von Riegan hailed from Almyra, sired by the long-missing Tiana von Riegan and the reigning king, that he was known as Khalid in his motherland. It was enough to erupt the entire Alliance in chaos.
	The news had shocked Dimitri, but he had more pressing issues: routing his uncle’s supporters, repairing his country from Rufus’ incompetent reign, preparing his people for the war Adrestia would likely bring to their doorstep. There was no time, no energy, no resources, to officially spare in mitigating or investigating the disaster unfolding to the east.
	Last he had heard, Claude von Riegan had been forcibly ousted from his position, placed under arrest under suspicion of espionage on behalf of Almyra, and that was before Almyra officially disowned him. He was held in Gloucester, awaiting trial, fate uncertain.
Until he escaped.
An Alliance-wide manhunt ensued. With every passing moon that he went unfound, the bounty for him rose. Some theorized he had made it across the border back into his home country to disappear, or similarly fled from Fódlan on a ship from Derdriu.
Either way, it seemed as if he had simply vanished.
Then, reports of ambushes on Adrestian soldiers began to spread, bearing marks of neither Alliance or Church doing. Poisoned arrows, poisoned food or water supplies. Traps set in the nearby woods, spike or rock-lined pitfalls and snares that left soldiers hanging from the trees.

Bodies riddled with arrows, signaling shots that only an experienced, exceedingly skilled archer could make. It was deliberate, and taunting.
Rumors spread.
And now, suspicions have given way to the truth standing before him, the proof coming from Claude’s own silver-tongued mouth.
But the man in front of him now is not the smiling boy from Garreg Mach, making jokes and making friends with a laugh that rang more sweetly than the chapel bells. There is a smile, to be sure—but it is hard, and cold, and cruel. His eyes are fire-glazed jade. Opaque. Dangerously calm, and deeply furious.
“What’s the matter, Mitri? I thought you had questions for me.”
Even his voice is different, delivered with a sharp, serrated edge that cuts invisible lines up Dimitri’s arms, even beneath his gauntlets.
Dimitri takes in a deep breath.
“I do.”
But he also wants to look.
There are dark circles beneath Claude’s eyes, his hair a long and barely coherent mess of dark waves that disappear into the back of his hooded scarf. His cheekbones cut out sharply, as does his jawline. His hands are bare at the moment, the fingernails brittle. He hasn’t been eating properly in who knows how long—who knows how Claude had stayed alive, undetected for so long after being wanted in two countries. Three, once he had started striking down the Church’s knights and therefore made it Faerghus’ problem by association.
And then there’s the scar…running from his nose, across his cheek, and disappearing around to where half his missing ear used to be.

""Dimitri wants to be angry. But somehow, he can’t summon the one emotion that is so familiar, he takes it with him to sleep.
“Why are you targeting Adrestian camps?”
Claude yawns. “Why shouldn’t I?”
“If it’s revenge you wanted, wouldn’t you have gone directly after the Alliance leaders? The ones who called for your abdication as heir of house Riegan?”
“Who said I wanted revenge?”
Dimitri sighs, and rubs his forehead.
“What else could you possibly want?”
“Now that’s a good question.” Claude smiles with a hint of teeth.
That makes Dimitri pause, and in the silence, Claude’s lip pulls higher. Their eyes catch, and it’s steady.
“…So.”
“So.” Claude echoes.
“What could you gain by targeting Adrestia? While making it so obvious it was you.” Dimitri muses, rubbing a hand over his jaw, while Claude tilts his head and shrugs.
Claude had left enough signs that he might as well have signed his name to the carnage he left behind, carving a trail across the country. It had only been because he’d traversed so deeply into Adrestia, that he’d eventually ended up in Western Faerghus to follow the invading army.","1152","1104","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:hhh5calcm5rnmeoffblmuoom/bafkreiafpm7smtn7pzfvvwhrfvgl3hixvu5yfhgbgjnyf3rpj6clgcxatm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:hhh5calcm5rnmeoffblmuoom/bafkreiafpm7smtn7pzfvvwhrfvgl3hixvu5yfhgbgjnyf3rpj6clgcxatm@jpeg","“I doubt you are trying to win the war single-handedly on the Alliance’s behalf,” Dimitri says carefully. “And I presume you aren’t helping our cause out of the goodness of your heart.”

The spot was Chicago and he hadn't intended to stop there at all. After six gruelling days in New York he'd been out at the airport, ready to Flagship back to California, when the home office called and asked him to stop off in Chicago to see an important prospect.
So here he was, an hour before his appointment, carrying a bag full of dirty laundry and wearing yesterday's soiled shirt. That was why he asked American Airlines Ticket Agent Harry McKenzie, ""Where's the nearest place I can buy a clean shirt in a hurry?""
Only then did he realize the spot he was in. For McKenzie gently reminded him, ""It's Sunday, sir, all the stores will be closed.""
Gloomily he outlined to McKenzie the story of his unexpected business in Chicago. McKenzie was a sympathetic man and fortunately a man of action too. ""If you'll tell me your shirt size, sir,"" he suggested, ""maybe I can help you."" And then he hurried off.
In an amazingly short time, McKenzie was back, a clean white shirt in hand. (He'd found an American Airlines' agent with the same shirt size who lived near the airport.)
Five minutes later the passenger emerged from the washroom looking as neat and trim as Easter Sunday-and twice as joyous. All of which answers the question-Should an airline give a passenger the shirt off its back? We, at American, say yes.

He struggled to keep his fangs and claws hidden. He had to relax. Did that female—that human—just reject him? This wasn’t happening. It couldn’t be. He forced himself to release the chair before his rage gave him away to Trish. A tight, artificial smile greeted her when she brought the items over to him.

“Should we have gone with blueberry?” he asked.

Sweet Trish gave an awkward shrug. “She was flattered, but…”

“It’s all right, thank you,” He glanced at her name tag—he shouldn’t know her name already. “Trish.”

“Um, here’s your check.” She blushed again and placed his bill in front of him. “She paid for what you got her so you didn’t waste your money.”

“I don’t consider it a waste at all.” He considered it a fucking insult. The gall of that woman.

Trish twirled a piece of her hair. “If you ask me, Jess is crazy to turn down a gentleman like you.”

He ignored her flirtation. “I appreciate that.”

“Try not to take it personally.”

redundant merge rules. For instance, in the LLAMA 3 merge list, we see the sequence of merges
_ the, _t he, and _th e, as well as _ and, _a nd, and _an d. Because the merge path for every
token is unique, it is impossible for more than one of these merges to ever be used, and we empirically
verify this by applying the tokenizer to a large amount of text.
We find that this is an artifact of the conversion from sentencepiece to Huggingface tokenizers
format. To construct the merge list, the conversion algorithm naively combines every pair of tokens
in the vocabulary, and then sorts them by token ID, which represents order of creation. While this
is functionally correct, because the redundant merges are not products of the BPE algorithm (i.e.,
they do not actually represent the most-likely next-merge), we need to remove them to apply our
algorithm. To do this, we do some simple pre-processing: for every cluster of redundant merges, we
record the path of merges that achieves each merge; the earliest path is the one that would be taken,
so we keep that merge and remove the rest.
As an aside, this means that a tokenizer’s merge list can be completely reconstructed from its
vocabulary list ordered by token creation. Given only the resulting token at each time step, we can
derive the corresponding merge.","651","1260","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:s62ilc26irrbo2dndmdzboqi/bafkreidezoddznl55bpsa7kqzuv5jca6fsyu7loqph7qsycx3zzrdhzyiq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:s62ilc26irrbo2dndmdzboqi/bafkreidezoddznl55bpsa7kqzuv5jca6fsyu7loqph7qsycx3zzrdhzyiq@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"3",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:s62ilc26irrbo2dndmdzboqi/bafkreidezoddznl55bpsa7kqzuv5jca6fsyu7loqph7qsycx3zzrdhzyiq@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I d!e","1","1","This is also addressed in the appendix of @alisawuffles.bsky.social and colleagues' paper on BPE mixture inference.

We are customers of your products related to the Ensemble Stars franchise. Recent events have damaged trust in the Happy Elements brand by association, negatively affected consumer experience, and offended us. We wish to share our concerns.

As of January 3, 2025, a fourth character, Ibuki Taki, was added to the Unit AKATSUKI. AKATSUKI has consisted of three members for the past nine years, up until now. This is unprecedented in the history of Ensemble Stars. The associated Event, 浮雲＊照らす翔装の華月伝, was advertised as 紅月with滝維吹 (AKATSUKI with Ibuki Taki). Following previous use of such language within Ensemble Stars, we had assumed it would be a temporary collaboration. However, the Event ended with the new character joining AKATSUKI. A warning was issued to players, which stipulated that they must not discuss the content of the second half of the Event Story on social media on the grounds of preventing spoilers to the plot. This, too, is unprecedented. We believe it to be proof that the team working on Ensemble Stars was aware of how inflammatory this change would be. We also believe it was an attempt to withhold information about the Event to extend engagement from players who would be dissatisfied upon learning of it. People shelled out money in the first half of the Event, only to learn in its finale that AKATSUKI is not simply collaborating with Ibuki Taki, but that Ibuki is now a member of the Unit. As a result of this lack of transparency, we as customers have lost faith in Happy Elements. We feel that we have been misled and betrayed.
","1024","688","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:lxqtd5oo7ta5t433qyfbcszj/bafkreiangk6yyu6jlzi3hyu3ybyjnhk75nixlacbrt7bx6ji3vi55qnj6q@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:lxqtd5oo7ta5t433qyfbcszj/bafkreiangk6yyu6jlzi3hyu3ybyjnhk75nixlacbrt7bx6ji3vi55qnj6q@jpeg","We are further concerned by the cultural insensitivity of Ibuki Taki's membership to AKATSUKI. Ibuki is Ryukyuan, while AKATSUKI is a Unit with a theme of traditional Japanese culture. In the Event Story, Ibuki explains that he wants to find true 和風—or Japanese style—because he feels out of place within his identity. As such, he joins AKATSUKI. He now wears traditional Japanese clothing and performs Japanese music. This is framed as a positive character development. The message that Ibuki ought to join AKATSUKI, effectively assimilating him into Japanese culture, to belong somewhere disturbs us. We feel that this is insensitive to the history and culture of the Ryukyuan people, who were colonized and forcefully assimilated by the Empire of Japan. We believe that Ryukyuan people are being disrespected by Happy Elements. A remake of the AKATSUKI song ""百花繚乱、紅月夜 (Hyakka Ryouran, Akatsukiyo),"" now with the four members, has been published. The music video features multiple shots in which the stage lighting resembles the symbol of the Rising Sun, which marked the flags of the Empire of Japan. This appears to us an endorsement of historical atrocities and support for the nationalistic ideology that fueled Japan’s colonization of the Ryukyu Islands and other parts of Asia.

We do not support the decision to add Ibuki Taki to AKATSUKI, and we have no desire to support a company that promotes imperialistic ideas. This series of events has caused severe harm to our trust in Happy Elements as a company and hurt our hearts as customers who have loved your products.

We ask that Ibuki Taki's membership to AKATSUKI be reversed or made temporary and that our concerns about cultural insensitivity be addressed.

Thank you.

This Week in Indiana History
The Indiana Pi Bill Passes the House:
February 6th, 1897
In 1897, Bill #246, famously known as the Indiana Pi
Bill, was introduced and passed by the House unani-
mously. In it, amateur Mathematician Edwin Goodwin
claimed that Pi was not the recognizable 3.14 everyone
came to know in grade school, but actually 3.2.
Goodwin, a proud Hoosier, intended to allow Indiana
schools to teach his copyrighted formula for free if the bill
became a law. However, other states would have to pay.
Fortunately, a visiting Purdue professor was in Indianapo-
lis and spoke with members of the Senate before they
took up the bill. After much ridicule, Bill #246 was
shelved indefinitely.","953","750","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kd4cyu4rpkgjbym3gckhrivz/bafkreiah7qekyeal7ij32h6nkcydhishs3mwgye5odtuw5snii4l3c4sem@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:kd4cyu4rpkgjbym3gckhrivz/bafkreiah7qekyeal7ij32h6nkcydhishs3mwgye5odtuw5snii4l3c4sem@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"25","GOP state lawmakers in 13 states have introduced at least 22 bills that would ban 'weather modification' based on claims made by fringe conspiracy theorists.","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:q325ug6pkcr6crqhe5lvhomr/bafkreihsr2yli6kfrrbfw3kszh3rtel66lnppslhpyliyxquh2lcoc2qha@jpeg","UPDATE: More GOP State Lawmakers Introduce Bills to Ban 'Chemtrails'","https://www.radicalreports.org/p/update-more-gop-state-lawmakers-introduce","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kd4cyu4rpkgjbym3gckhrivz/bafkreiah7qekyeal7ij32h6nkcydhishs3mwgye5odtuw5snii4l3c4sem@jpeg?f=.jpeg","if I d!e","4","15","","https://bsky.app/profile/charlesgaba.com/post/3lggzohfkzc25"

Seeing is believing: Is video modality more powerful in spreading fake news via online messaging apps?
S Shyam Sundar, Maria D Molina, Eugene Cho
Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 26
(6), 301-319, 2021
False rumors on WhatsApp, the world's largest messaging app, have led to mob lynching in India and other countries. Doctored videos sent over the platform have elicited visceral responses among users, resulting in the wrongful death of innocent people. Would the responses have been so strong if the false news were circulated in text or audio? Is video modality the reason for such powerful effects? We explored this question by comparing reactions to three false stories prepared in either text-only, audio-only, or video ormats, among rural and urban users in India.
[highlighted] Our findings reveal that video is processed more superficially, and therefore users believe in it more readily and share it with others.

Our conference on May 3, “The Medieval Uncanny”, explores how medieval texts present opportunities for resistance, textual or otherwise, that help us imagine different futures. That same kind of thinking has been seen in protests across the United States for the past two weeks, where students have been demanding that their schools divest from Israel, rather than be complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. So too at CUNY, where last week students, faculty and staff erected a solidarity encampment at City College, which included teach-ins, children’s programming, and a community assembly. Despite the encampment’s commitment to the principles of nonviolent resistance, on the night of April 30th, the NYPD was given permission by CUNY administration to enter campus, beating, pepper spraying, and arresting demonstrators. These are our students, faculty mentors, colleagues, and friends.","1422","1179","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ojjdavnev4fb3bod3wnbokiy/bafkreicvuvgicg3e6kopsnfkplmcf2zuyuyguclid3lsim4dadj2jcdnai@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ojjdavnev4fb3bod3wnbokiy/bafkreicvuvgicg3e6kopsnfkplmcf2zuyuyguclid3lsim4dadj2jcdnai@jpeg","We condemn this assault on academic freedom and freedom of expression in the strongest possible terms. Our event brings together some of the brightest minds in our field from around the world. We refuse to let the Graduate Center benefit from the prestige and creativity of our event without condemning CUNY’s brutalization of students and faculty, including those from the Graduate Center. CUNY administration must apologize for violating the human rights of demonstrators, and engage with their demands for disclosure, divestment, and a free CUNY for all.

As medievalists, we understand how history is viewed quite differently in the moment of its arrival than it is in retrospect. Any medieval organization that wishes to remain relevant must have the moral clarity to stand on the right side of history now: with student protestors, with academic freedom, and with the people of Gaza enduring an ongoing genocide.

 Now dont get me wrong l'm a big fan of the Dawn Chorus, it's uplifting, noisy and can be quite ethereal at times, but what about that other great chorus time... Early evening or Dusk?
 I live in a part Rural (Parkland, Fields, Dam to one side) Part Suburban (Northern Industrial Town to the other side) area, a sort of Sub-Rural location if you like, and any time between 6pm and 10pm I get the same usual suspects singing away, however to me its far better as,
 A) get tO hear a FULL song as opposed to loads - of interruptions from rival males.
 B) I can hear Song Thrush sing.
C) I can enjoy a nice Glass of something intoxicating whilst listening to bird song.

If you plan on attempting a 2 run 1/4 D-ratio I suggest going to the fairy colony to break up the monotony of the e-loops and keep your ant stores well stocked.

Its the strangest feeling to Astoria, her belly is still big enough for people to think that shes pregnant. When she pushes on her belly though, its soft, her empty uterus a void in the center of her body. Its still expanded enough to house a baby inside, but is slowly shrinking back down. It can take a little while.

Astoria has also experienced her first orgasm while breast feeding the twins. It was pretty embarrassing to her, then Celesse explained that it was the rush of oxytocin her body releases while shes breast feeding. Nature making her feel good about feeding her babies.

The train is visible through the station's fence, with the lights inside the carriages casting a soft glow that contrasts sharply with the surrounding darkness. The structure of the platform, with its sturdy pillars and metal framework, gives the image a strong industrial feel.

The graininess of the photo, likely due to the high ISO used during its capture, adds texture and a raw, gritty quality that is often associated with urban night photography. This visual style enhances the sense of quiet and solitude, evoking the feeling of late-night travels where the world seems at once both vast and intensely private.

The empty space below the platform and the solitary, partially visible signs and structures contribute to the overall narrative of urban life and transit.",,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kqoe6lpegc6hg24wqhfll53a/bafkreiggf4npdcfmuzu74higprtjqlxfdjo6ju4vrqa3eodvmuzstonciu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:kqoe6lpegc6hg24wqhfll53a/bafkreiggf4npdcfmuzu74higprtjqlxfdjo6ju4vrqa3eodvmuzstonciu@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"de",,,"55",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kqoe6lpegc6hg24wqhfll53a/bafkreiggf4npdcfmuzu74higprtjqlxfdjo6ju4vrqa3eodvmuzstonciu@jpeg?f=.jpeg","feel empty inside","1","5","","https://bsky.app/profile/freikampf.bsky.social/post/3ksbmjbwyds2n"

I was washing up prior to toppling over into an empty and unmade bed and out of nowhere I could feel a hair growing out of my temple. A white one. 

I could hear it too almost. Its sprouting. 

This is the kind of thing that happens backstage every microsecond of every day for every mammal that has ever existed but somehow I had caught it in flagrante delicto. When it must have assumed I would have my defenses down. It sort of hurt on top of it all. My hair had never hurt me before now. It was as if a new tooth was coming in on the side of my skull. Watching a pimple form in real time. 

Or a scar healing. Which was also happening inside of me so much slower than I needed it to.

I just want to do something in journalism (that’s what I went to school for, after all).
I just want to help people and do something that makes me feel good.

I want to continue my work as a Tournament Organizer. I also want to do things in Event Planning and Organization!
And, above all else, I just want to do something that allows me to do that thing, but also gives me enough of a work-life balance to do all the things that I already love.

If I move away, I will feel extremely guilty about leaving the New England Mystery Game scene behind with no one to run mystery games on Mondays. And, honestly, the less I say about leaving New England Sailor Moon S/Hype AF Fighting Games (and BBB, to that end) behind, the better — those losses would break my heart. All of them are my family away from home.

Furthermore, and I’m going to get vulnerable here, I still live with my parents (and it’s a miracle they haven’t thrown me out to find my own way). They are both older folks (with one a few years away from 70 and the other, the aforementioned “pops,” turning 74 this year) and I am eternally grateful to them…but it just scares me knowing that my chances to “make them proud” (beyond graduating college) are dwindling, and I don’t want to have that bite me in the ass. 

I’m just stuck and super, super frustrated with the general course of my life, is what I’m effectively saying in far more verbose terms. I should’ve done so many things different [sic] regarding the aftermath of the layoff (i.e. putting stuff away in savings, not getting too cocky about finding a new job in a snap, and a whole lot of other things), is also what I should be saying. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for hearing me out. I love you.

Says the man who uses fountain pens on the regular.

My point is, perhaps you should reevaluate weather or not you are a hipster, Magnus.

E: …I'm sorry, that was supposed to be a joke…

A hipster is someone who uses things for the ironic, retro, or visibility factor. Someone's who'd ""demonstrably"" eclectic, instead of actually eclectic.

I use fountain pens, because they're a better writing instrument for writing by hand. I also don't use them ""on the regular"", they're the only writing instruments I carry. They're not affectations, they're a part of my usual life, and a conscious choice. I've yet to meet a hipster who uses fountain pens, because they're not very visible to everyone else, and require regular maintenance.

I'm less ""hipster"" and more ""actually interesting person.""

A: “I’ve always liked to draw, and while I’m not a painter, I enjoy painting. In the case of Eternity’s Gate, I had a very good painting teacher in Julian Schnabel, the director. When we started, he had me look at a tree, and he said, “Paint the light, don’t think of rushing to paint the tree. Paint what you see. You make a mark and then you make another mark, and you see them turn into something.” It’s not a representation of the tree. It’s an expression of what you see. That keys you into the interplay of things. And when you become sensitive to that, it makes you more flexible in your thinking, so you’re not always going for that pure utility of things.

Without even an apology, he left the shadow of the tree out into the main road. He walked quickly to intercept a demon in fierce, spiked black armor. Su Xiyan could not see their face through the beast-faced helmet. 

Something struck her oddly about the scene. Perhaps it was Zhuzhi-Lang's posture. He stood upright, with his chin thrown high, nearly regla. An air of command laid around him, so unlike the slouching nervous boy who trailed behind her and Tianlang-Jun, often fumbling with the money pouch or Tianlang-Jun's shopping haul.

“One of the troop commanders,” Tianlang-Jun said offhand. His eyes were fixed on her hand on the bench, to which he was inching his own fingers. “I don't remember their name. Zhuzhi-Lang will know.”

“Troop commander?” 

“Or a guard. I can never remember which armor type that is, they all look basically the same. I hate having them follow me around, so I—” 

“Why would troop commanders follow you around?” A sense of foreboding rose up her spine. Suddenly, this little space beneath the tree felt frightfully open, unguarded. She pulled her hand from the bench to clench in her lap. 

Tianlang-Jun looked up. Confusion clouded the teasing light in his eyes. “They might be here to speak with my nephew, to be fair to him.” 

“For Zhuzhi-Lang.

Su Xiyan felt hyperaware of her own skin and hollow beneath it. Like she was on the edge of a cliff. ”He is a general, they often come to him for orders.”

“Ah. I did not know your nephew was in the army. Nor so high ranked.” She said this all politely, detached. Pieces began to fall together. She did not like the picture they made. She had to ask, “To whom does your nephew report?” 

“.... Xiyan, are you alright?” 

The landscape beyond the town wall grew golden and crimson in turns as the sun began to set, painting each leaf with harsh and beautiful light. 

“Who is his commanding offic-” 

“Me, Xiyan, he reports to me,” Tianlang-Jun interrupted. Su Xiyan turned her head with great effort to face him. A smile sat on his face, ill-fitting: it fell off almost as soon as it grew.

The crickets’ song became rushing white noise. Through her own swirling thoughts, she heard him say, “You know this. Xiyan, you knew that, didn't you? We have spoken...”

Clarity rang through her like a great bell. She had wondered: why him? A noble, high ranking enough to be a worthy target, but loose enough to be accessible, yes, but even someone in what counted for an Imperial court of demons surely could only give them so much. Why her? Why not a shidi or shimei more suited to espionage? But now. She understood. This was no ordinary target. No simple information gathering. Only the best could hunt the most dangerous game. 

The Emperor of the Demon Realm was rumored to be a rare, frightful being from a heavenly lineage. He commanded from the shadows. No cultivator had ever survived fighting him.

And yeah, it's not the most diverse thing Netflix has, but it's not on Julia Quinn. I hate to ever be put in a position where I am forced to defend Shonda Rhimes because I don't like that woman.

And I don't like that she has no historical knowledge of romance because this is the same woman who in an interview said that Julia Quinn is more spicy. This is not a direct quote, but she was saying, well, Julia Quinn is more spicy than Jane Austen. First of all, fuck you.

Second of all, there would be no Julia Quinn if it wasn't for Jane Austen. Third, Jane Austen wrote contemporary romance for her time. All of that fervent handholding and inner yearning, that came from Jane Austen.

There would be no on-page sex if it wasn't for the work that she had done. So I don't think that you should open your mouth to speak about romance, especially in defense of Julia Quinn. Furthermore, that is a very nasty lady with a very sick obsession with interracial romance.","1469","1150","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:uajcdhsabyf4t7a3qgclm55x/bafkreidgm43kncjm7a22bh3elnotjngziw2mzwpcawsmkmjrhg5sr6hsqu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:uajcdhsabyf4t7a3qgclm55x/bafkreidgm43kncjm7a22bh3elnotjngziw2mzwpcawsmkmjrhg5sr6hsqu@jpeg","“And I say this as someone that is biracial and has been in many an interracial romance in my life. I don't think that you should be allowed to talk about romance at all, because your Republican white man fetish has become a problem and I'm sick of it. And furthermore, you went out of your way to rewrite Bridgerton so that a white woman sexually assaulted a black man.

I am disgusted that I have ever had to be in a position to defend Shonda Rhimes and her vision of interracial swirl bliss. Interracial swirl bliss. Now that I've said that, I think that a lot of authors will make mistakes, obviously, especially white authors, will make mistakes in their attempt to better representation in their works.”

""I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I've become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I don't want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me.  I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me, and to smile at those who don't want to smile at me.
I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that's why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.""

It doesn't take much effort to show kindness to someone, so I don't feel like I'm good enough to deserve even a little respect. And being a man, I'm supposed to pretend to be confident and bottle up my emotions around women. I don't have any woman I can really talk to about my problems and enjoy spending time with.

There was a man who will show up at your wedding with a roulette wheel, for those people who want the ambience of elopement but are too chickenshit to ditch their loved ones for Vegas. An Elvis impersonator croons ""please welcome Dale, father of the bride, uh huh"".
There was a service that floods your wedding with fake waiters who will become a singing dancing flashmob, where all the male dancers serenade the groom, all the female dancers serenade the bride, and you don't get to pick the song. It is nice to see a service for people who hate their guests and don't want them to have a nice time. An advisor whispers to a half-naked Don Corleone ""wrong kind of flash mob, sir"".

The most awkward though was the photobooth. It had an operator who asked us to do the basic fun poses: ready to rumble (where we square up for a fist fight), early-00's rom-com (where we lean back to back with a little bit of sass), the Duck Soup mirror skit (where we act as each other's reflection). 
But then he asked us to kiss. We had not kissed yet, and I am a bad kisser. There is nothing good I can do with my mouth, and I include CPR in that. When I think back to my CPR lessons I think how you're meant to do compressions to the rhythm of Stayin' Alive by The Beegees, and when I start to think about that I start thinking about how The Beegees are essentially a British Beach Boys but don't get the credit for it, and that Barry Gibb is our Brian Wilson, but if Barry is our Brian does that make Maurice Gibb our Mike Love?!

The ancient remains of a celestial cetacean, a hollow mountain range of unbreakable bones which intrepid settlers segmented into a labyrinth of rooms, hidden spaces, corridors, combining to make a city within the shell of the stellar creature’s skeleton. 

The great whale spent centuries among the stars before dying, drifting, descending to this desert, its final resting place.

We were drawn to this place, too. Outcasts, freaks, exiles. We made it a shelter. Not a home, not a sanctuary, but a place to exist between running. A foxhole where predators run when they've become prey.

We’ve made it our own. Learned how to live together in something like peace. We all hate each other. We all rely on each other. We’ve found ways not to kill each other in the one place we’re allowed to simply exist and live our lives. Some of us pushed the limits of that acceptance but, overall, everyone who comes here is granted the right to survive, whatever that means to them.

People who come here tend to be desperate. Anyone with options would skip to a more respectable planet in a heartbeat. This is what we’re left with. This is where you land when you fall.

 In the second panel Jacky's eyes are wild (and green) with recognition. On the right of the panel, Eliza is being seen from the back, but because she's presented as all white, the panel just becomes a wash of white, creating an unbalanced feeling to the composition.

Hello - I’m the one who purchased the domain for @ChayaRaichik10
 and I’m currently building her website. 

After many warnings “advising” me to not move forward, I’ve decided to release a new page every other day until the full website is finished. Tonight, please enjoy the “About Me” section and get to know the insufferable Chaya. Much more to come.

Surprised that Neo-Nazi demonstrations of this sort are legal in Australia!

These are the people we need to unite against.
The people who love to hate and spread hate.
Hatred against Jews. Hatred against Muslims. Hatred against Women. Hatred against Migrants. Hatred against anyone who doesn't hate as much as they do.

They thrive by sowing division amongst decent people, by turning us against each other.
The vast majority of us who condemned Hamas attacks on October 7, Islamic extremism and terror worldwide and atrocities committed by Israel in Palestine.

I know some of my Jewish friends are upset with me for that last point.

To those friends I want to say that I hope some day you will know that I have always and will always stand up against antisemitic hatred.

It’s on LinkedIn, amongst “like minded professionals” that I first found my voice. 

Now I’m reminded of how radioactive I’ve become 😔. 

I still do it because someone needs to!

by Ozzy Osbourne

All aboard Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Crazy, but that's how it goes 
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late, To learn how to love
And forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing, Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
Let's go

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts, Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it, and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming,Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah
Heirs of a cold war, That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing, Who and what's to blame?
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
The ledge, ha-ha, the edge

He’d known coming into it that he’d be pushed to his limit, but that didn’t even count the god damn finalizing designs to make sure that they had enough new looks for the show.  It meant that he was barely able to text Stede between meetings, instead he was in his sketch book or dictating notes to Izzy.
Perhaps it was knowing that he was ending his day with something other than his hotel room and the gaping feel of exhaustion, but he threw himself into his role.  He knew how to design, he knew how to lean into the darkness and edgy designs that Blackbeard was known for.  They weren’t everyday designs either.  It was all Haute Couture, wild designs that were larger than life, shit that had made Blackbeard famous.  He leaned into it.
Perhaps it was thinking about how long he’d been living a lie, but he dragged out the old designs from when he’d been younger.  They had all been aimed at creating a persona strong enough to warn others away.  They were fueled by anger and fear, a darkness that had been scarred into his skin.  He reworked sketches, added embellishments, created looks that were smoky and intimidating, tying in the theme of the depths of the ocean.  
“You still got it, boss.”  Izzy gave him a tight smile as they left the latest appointment, glancing over at the designs.

“’Course you did, Iz.”  Ed muttered and flopped into the backseat of the car, flicking on his tablet with a frown.  “You always think that.”
“I think we can pull most of this off, but you’re gonna want to review models.”  Izzy slanted a look at Ed. “I can schedule that in tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah, s’fine.”  Ed muttered and tried not to grimace at the amount of black on his designs. “Y’think maybe we can add in some red?”
“What?”  Izzy’s brows shot up to his hairline.  
“Red, some sorta color.”  He pursed his lips and made a few notations on the jacket design, adjusting the cut of the coat to be higher, just beneath the chest.  
“You don’t do color.”  Izzy blinked a few times and narrowed his eyes.  “Ed, don’t mess with what works.”
“Why?  M’fuckin’ Blackbeard, mate, I can do what I want.”  He tapped a finger on the edge of his tablet before looking at the dark design, the shades of black blending together.  “C’mon, be daring, dash of color in all that black.”
“For a new designer?  Yeah.  For you?  It’d get all the wrong reactions.”  Izzy sighed and furrowed his brows. “Ed, ya gotta keep it together.  You wanna get creative? Fuckin’ toss it on another designer, let them take the risk.”

Just pack it in?”
“Blackbeard is a legend, Ed.  Legends don’t get to retire.”  The other omega’s voice was almost sympathetic for the grumpy bastard.  “You’ve pulled back from the public eye, that’s gotta be enough.”
“So what?  I do this until I fuckin’ die?”  Ed slanted an angry look at Izzy.  “Just keep pumping out this shit and then keel over, fuck, even my casket would be black.”
“Don’t get all mopey, twat!”  There was a frustrated sigh.  “You have a damn empire, peoples’ jobs count on you, those fuckin’ designers, omegas you hired, they need Blackbeard.”
“They shouldn’t need an alpha to get ahead.”  Ed muttered, feeling a bitter churn in his belly.  “S’fucked.”
“Yeah, it is, but it’s the world, you can’t change the fuckin’ world, Edward, just survive in it.”  Izzy repeated the old wisdom.  “Right, next up, we’re meeting with Vogue, they want to arrange a photo shoot.  I had Fang bring over that tentacle jacket, but they wanted the original look.”
“’Course they do.”  Ed muttered and flicked his tablet off after sending off the designs.  Just one more meeting and then he’d be able to retreat to hang out with Stede.  He could shed away Blackbeard and just be Ed.

I’ve gone through a rough break up with my ex-fiancée and I’m living alone — truly by myself, no roommates, in a studio apartment — for the first time in my life. I’m generally very depressed at this point, and I decide one night, after a long stretch of sad solo dinners at home, to treat myself to a night at the movies.

Every year during the Academy Awards, when they get to the short film nominees, I tell myself “Those look good, next year I’m gonna watch all those bad boys” and then, of course, the next year comes round and the bad boys remain unwatched. But this year, in an effort to shock myself back into happiness by shaking up my routine, I take action, look up showtimes, find that my favorite walking-distance theater has some, and buy a ticket. As I walk out and head for the theater, for the first time in weeks, I’m feeling pretty okay.

I get there, get high, and head inside to settle in for the slate: all five entries are shown back-to-back in one screening that is roughly the length of a feature film. The first short is a Spanish entry called Madre, directed by Rodrigo Sorogoyen.","1290","1412","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","(Warning: If you had any intention of watching the 2019 Oscar short films — and if you haven’t picked it up by now, I am ultimately going to recommend that you do not — then it is my duty to inform you that plot spoilers lie ahead for all five films, but the details, I’m afraid, are important.)

Madre is mostly one sustained take, wherein a young woman returns home from a shopping trip with her mother in tow, just as she’s receiving a call on her cell phone. On the other end of the call is her 6-year-old son. The boy, on vacation with his father (the woman’s estranged husband), is alone and lost on a beach.

She naturally begins asking her son questions, only some of which he is able to answer with any clarity, but which illuminate the basic details: the boy’s father and some friends took the boy on a planned surfing trip somewhere on the coast of France — or maybe Spain; the boy’s grasp of geography is still weak — but they somehow became separated and now the boy can’t find them.

Oh, also: his cell phone battery is dying.","1282","1436","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","The woman’s mother watches on from the kitchen table in agony, helpless.

The woman tells the boy to hang tight and calls the police. They aren’t much help but they tell her to come down to the station. As she’s leaving to do so, she gets another call. It’s the boy again. His battery is almost dead — but now there’s a stranger on the beach, a man, and he’s noticed the boy.

The boy says he’s scared. She tells him to run. She hears him find a hiding spot behind a rock, but it’s too late. The man spots the boy and starts approaching — when the battery dies. The call ends. The woman screams and rushes out of the apartment, and the camera lands on the horrified face of her mother.

The end.

HOOOOOOOooooooookay.

I take a deep breath. It‘s an incredibly well done piece, but Madre is a fucking fraught tale of child endangerment, expertly directed to crank the tension to maximum levels. In between films one and two, the room is kinda buzzing with energy. I enjoyed it, but I hope quietly that lighter fare is on the way.

It’s all fun and games until one boy is swallowed whole by some sort of quicksand— extremely, excruciatingly slowly — right in front of his buddy.

After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the friend flees for help. He climbs for hours over giant, dune-like heaps of gravel, in a montage reminiscent of an old-Hollywood Arabian epic, until finally being picked up by a passing motorist, a nice older woman.

When she leaves him in the car at a gas station to call for help, he begins to sob when he spots something outside the window: a frolicking fox, disappearing into the tree line.

(second post)
Theres a sentiment I'm noticing in the tags that I'd like to address.  I dont think learning to love bugs with all your heart means forcing yourself out of discomfort you have with them overnight. It's about observing a different sort of being going about its life and deliberately trying to reframe your observations through a sense of wonder and delight. It's about cultivating a positive interest and curiosity for their ecology and behaviors. It's especially about trying to uncouple the value we find in them from how 'convenient' they are to us; to face head on the part of us that wants to assign moral evil to another organism who just happens to live life in a way that is not harmonius with ours. You can love insects in this way and still recognize your own health and safety needs. We are animals living side by side within a biosphere. This is how it is, sometimes.

I think this is important to cultivate because, if you are alive at all, you are coming into conflict with countless other people and things that dont owe you an apology for their existance and needs. If you are alive at all, you are encountering countless other people and things that harmful bias and personal discomfort have made repulsive to you. This is about bugs, but its also about way more than bugs.""","610","471","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ezahiubeokbmjhvwhkbn6t5b/bafkreiamyilr2nbvq7jigzunaulbqpcxhx7g7br6dz3qck54geh4e7nvwu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ezahiubeokbmjhvwhkbn6t5b/bafkreiamyilr2nbvq7jigzunaulbqpcxhx7g7br6dz3qck54geh4e7nvwu@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"6",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ezahiubeokbmjhvwhkbn6t5b/bafkreiamyilr2nbvq7jigzunaulbqpcxhx7g7br6dz3qck54geh4e7nvwu@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I'm not living","0","1","","https://bsky.app/profile/kirauriel.bsky.social/post/3lidp5i3n7c2j"

They're a quadrapedal wolf made out of leaves, bark.  Sylvanos main body is a dark green, with lighter green leaves accenting his mane, hindlegs and upper end of his tail. Two bulky forelegs are clad in bark, which go down the spine as exoskeletal ribs. On the tip of their tail is a red bulb, which can shoot seeds. Behind the green mane, there's also a pair of red bulbs, which can sprout vines.

Sylvanos is almost always seen angry, baring their fangs. Not that surprising, because they're basically the avatar of a vengeful wood that's being burned down. On the other hand, Sylvanos can be quite murderous, driving people living in the forest to take to the treetops, because the ground is too dangerous.","1400","1400","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:3lmuewq3ak6lswj6vbyeu4gv/bafkreid3uhggc4zej6adqdadhbexgk4pnpuqmlq3jhi4u2mv2zvckv6o7m@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:3lmuewq3ak6lswj6vbyeu4gv/bafkreid3uhggc4zej6adqdadhbexgk4pnpuqmlq3jhi4u2mv2zvckv6o7m@jpeg","Slayer is a very gentlemanly vampire from Guilty Gear, this is specifically his Strive incarnation.

Slayer is a sharpy dressed and very laid back vampire wearing mostly black. He has a fully black suit and wears an equally black cape with a dark red inside (although it's actually an overcoat which also turns into bats, it's complicated, ok?). He always tries to look sharp with a confident grin with well-groomed mustache and beard. Ironically, he has crosses on his outfit, no one knows why, but perhaps it's in defiance of the church.

In-universe Slayer is known to be an immortal vampire who likes to fight for fun.

Testament is dressed in a long overcoat, showing a lot of their arms and legs. Their long flowing hair is flowing out from under their top hat, sporting a very refined look. They have a dark side though, with skulls and who can of course forget the giant honking scythe they're holding, topped off with a skull.

In-universe, Testament was turned into a Gear against their will, and brainwashed by a bad guy. After this all went down, Testament was scorned by the public, until they met Dizzy. Testament fiercely protected, her seeing something of themself in her. After the Dizzy situation wound down, we wouldn't see Testament for a while.

It feels a little bloated. However, even as it makes reading the book less enjoyable, the level of detail reminds you that these are all individual people, children, with lives and dreams and fears, being tortured and slaughtered, not numbers. In seeing a little of each life, no matter how sparse, we see more fully every death.

In a similar tension, the violence and gore is a bit more brutal than the film, which makes it feel pulpy sometimes — but at other times, it's effective in heightening the dissonance between the glossy, caring facade of what Takami describes as ""successful fascism,"" and the nauseatingly cruel reality of fascism, its calculated yet senseless violence. A fascinating effect when it appears, even if the book largely falls into the category of exploitation pulp, missing a more articulate satire in its lack of subtlety.","1857","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreibld63qjp2nviswpqg46pnp6z2ubdfteg5akiz43uacahbmi4bnp4@jpeg","Maybe the connotations of ""exploitation"" are a bit misleading here, though; there's a palpable anger behind the hyperviolence, not an aim to cash in, at least on the author's part, not that I can sense — a louder, more visceral expression of youth unrest in 90s Japan. Snapshots of what youth become, what they become capable of doing and compelled to do, in such an oppressive world. Takami's 2009 afterword is revealing; he writes that ""the nation that would serve as the setting for the novel was added later,"" but ""Still, I thought that figurative county couldn't be written any differently [...] I wanted to write about the trapped feeling of living in Japan I've felt clearly since childhood — at the very least, from middle school on [...] When I was born, near the end of the '60s, there existed even in Japan the sort of culture where a college student would throw Molotov cocktails at police. But in the '80s, when I was a teenager, that environment had vanished. Maybe everyone became disillusioned when they discovered that even throwing Molotov cocktails at police didn't change anything. This may be related to my feeling of trapped hopelessness.""

Battle Royale was rejected in the final round of the 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, leaving no winner that year; the judges admitted it was the best work, but as judge Mariko Hayashi put it, ""I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this."" The decade preceding its publication was marked by the murder of Junko Furuta and the Kobe child murders, the decade following by Tsutomu Miyazaki's serial murders and the Sasebo slashing —and, in the US, Columbine. It has gone on to become a cult hit globally and shaped popular culture deeply. It spoke (and speaks) to coming of age in an increasingly pressurized world that warps and crushes, of eating or being eaten and finding the strength to choose neither, to keep running.

And, ultimately, I think that that matters more than the prose being amateur, the characters sometimes flat and hamfisted. The roughness is part of that feeling Battle Royale evokes: the raw, juvenile cry for help.","2000","1019","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreib3kcjc7syo7rvymkla7etlayzaphhp6e5scnwtxrntrmgubvh4dq@jpeg","en",,,"2",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:sbkpz5j6vy2jqd4v2q7v5oy3/bafkreidceixvnmoyivcavhp43d3tddpjf73cvteyf3ueztbovkufgcae6y@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I'm not living","1","0","📚🌟3️⃣ BATTLE ROYALE 📖 バトル・ロワイアル (remastered ver., koushun takami, 1999 / 2014, tr. nathan collins) www.bookwormreads.co/rubyfire77/s...","https://bsky.app/profile/rubyfire77.bsky.social/post/3lj72tztcq22m"

title: like true lovers do
author: fat_chocobo

summary: 
Sanji hadn’t expected the love of his life to be the quiet, shy orphan boy he’d grown up alongside, but he wouldn’t trade Zoro for the world. They don’t have much, but they’ve got each other and their love, and it’s all Sanji needs. Zoro wants to give him more, so he sends his mosshead off to earn his fortune with a tearful goodbye and the promise to kick his ass when he gets back.

Hearing the news of Zoro’s death at the hands of pirates nearly breaks him completely, and ending up as Prince Klahadore’s chosen bride just adds insult to injury. How is he meant to ever love another when his heart has been lost at sea?

He needn’t lose all hope, though. It’s as Zoro told him: death cannot stop true love—all it can do is delay it for a while.

GitHub no longer seems to allow us to use nested virtualization on the macos-12 image
We need nested virtualization in order to create VMs during CI to run our playbook
Nested virtualization isn't enabled on macos-13
They claim it's enabled for large runner instances
These are paid
They are ubuntu not macOS
I signed up, tested, and it didn't seem to work
Rewrote the playbook to work with Linux (ubuntu)
I ended up self-hosting a VM myself
Nested virtualization
16 cores
64 GB RAM
100 GB SSD
Due to nested virtualization it's still slow, but stable
Another downside is that you can only run on job at a time on a self-hosted runner. GHA really needs to start using containers like every other CI out there instead of stateful VMs.
If this becomes a problem I will break the one I have into 3. It doesn't effectively or efficiently use the resources I gave it now, probably due to nested virtualization.

Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe that given the cowardice I have witnessed since October 7, 2023, which has made it far more difficult to navigate folx like yourself.

“As a U.S. citizen exercising my free speech, I began warning about Mike Flynn, QAnon and Russian interference in our elections starting in August 2020, during the first Trump administration. In the 4 1/2 years since, I have experienced a ruthless onslaught of attacks for my reporting, which includes “lawfare” — the intentional weaponization of the legal system as part of an effort to silence, disrupt or harm an opponent.

The first lawsuit was by retired Lt. General Mike Flynn — a remarkable piece of legal propaganda that regurgitated a number of smear campaigns created by Flynn’s trolls, stalkers, and media plants, which accused me of calling him various names. It started as a $75,000 lawsuit engineered to stay in Sarasota Court. When the judge didn’t cooperate as he hoped, Flynn escalated his lawsuit to include Rick Wilson for $10 million in federal court, then added MeidasTouch for $50 million. Their crimes were acknowledging that I exist.

When that failed to stop me from speaking out, Flynn had his good friend and loyal operative Kash Patel, formerly Chief of Staff in the Pentagon on J6 and slated for a hearing to be FBI Director, copycat sue me for $10 million in Nevada. Among the accusations of Kash Patel is that I called him a “chud” and a “Kremlin asset,” all of which is true.
￼
In the last few weeks, Russian state media has said that Kash Patel is “our boy” who will be “a beaut,” “dismantle America brick by brick,” and turn the FBI into a “museum of political repression.””

“I have first-hand knowledge of this reality, now. As I write this, my lawyers are spending money Mike Flynn and Kash Patel know I don’t have — to punish me for the crime of telling the truth about them, and to challenge the Sullivan Rule, which protects journalists who write about “public figures,” a role Flynn and Patel pride themselves on. They know their cases will never prevail, and that I have nothing to give them if they did. But that is not the point.

This is “hybrid” or “fifth generation warfare” against what they perceive as a dangerous opponent. It’s a small example of “political repression,” to quote the Russians. My rights as an American are being trampled right now. They were being trampled during the Biden Administration — because our justice system is already broken. It’s an ancient, glacial, incomprehensible mess driven by money, power and influence. It needs a reboot.

Regardless, imagine what Patel and Flynn will do with the power of the federal government, not just to me, but to the nation. If they will go to these lengths to silence one guy who writes on Twitter and Substack, what will they do to media organizations, to political opponents, and to marginalized communities?

When they say they want “retribution,” what they mean is they want to erase history of their own crimes. They are engaged in a massive Goebbels-like DARVO (Deny, Accuse, Reverse Victim & Offender) campaign to blame Democrats, “Russiagate” and whatever other conspiracy theories they can conjure up for crimes they committed themselves. They will now have the ability to enforce this alternate reality with the full power of the federal government.”","2000","732","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:bczc6eciaaciu66zxdgkiywl/bafkreicwbkruptjpdsctwpuvthkxpvld6kurtzlkbhrdc773rn55s32uia@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:bczc6eciaaciu66zxdgkiywl/bafkreicwbkruptjpdsctwpuvthkxpvld6kurtzlkbhrdc773rn55s32uia@jpeg","“The best example of how I expect a Patel-led FBI to function is like the Stasi, the East German secret police, who implemented a program on their own people called Zersetzung. 

This type of “silent repression” is what they want. Everyone must play along with the alternate reality, the alternate history, they are trying to create, or be silenced — by the state.

Kash Patel is a dangerous sociopath, a foreign agent, and an enemy of American democracy. If we put him in charge of the FBI, no one, anywhere, will be safe.”

The word 'slides' is highlighted.

I see Katie and AJ approaching from across the way now. I’m still confused by all of this, but we have to wrap it up quickly.
“Ok, two things, Kyle. One, she’s not proposing marriage. Just relax and have some great sex, dude! Two, you think you aren’t good enough for her, so you won’t give her a chance? Shouldn’t that be up to her to decide? Or are you ok with taking that choice away from her?”
His mouth hangs open and he just blinks at me.
“Well?” I say. “No rebuttal to that, Mr. Martyr?”
He puts a finger up. “I… uh... When I get smacked in the face with the Truth Bat, I need a minute to process.”
I slap him on the shoulder. “I told you, I’m never wrong. Trust Rachel, my friend, and you’ll do fine. Just make sure to treat her right tonight and take care of her needs, ok? Now pick your chin up off the floor, they’re back.”
Katie literally hops the last few steps back over to us. “You two ready to get back out there?” Even AJ looks excited to keep dancing.
“Almost,” I say. “Kyle’s bladder just woke up, so I guess we should make a quick pit stop, too. How about you two get out there and we’ll join ya in a minute?”
“Sure!” She hugs me. “Love ya, babe! Hurry!” Then she puts a hand on Kyle’s shoulder and locks eyes with him. As she walks away, she slides her hand all the way down his arm without breaking eye contact, a move I imagine she picked up watching me. “I will be waiting for you,” she purrs.
After they leave, I slap Kyle on the back again. “Damn! I hope you don’t think it’s weird, but I would pay to watch you two tonight, loverboy!

Last night, I woke up and realized someone had butchered my hair. One side is a jagged pixie cut, and the other side hangs awkwardly past my shoulder. At first, I thought I was losing my mind-maybe I sleepwalked or something -but no. I confronted my husband, Tim, because he's been acting weird lately, but he denied it. Then he drops this bombshell: ""My mom... she might've done it."" Apparently, my MIL (let's call her Diane) is convinced I've been cheating on Tim. Why? Because last week, she saw me having lunch with a coworker. For the record, the coworker (Kyle) is gay and we were literally talking about work. But Diane decided I must be having an affair and, instead of, you know, talking to me or Tim, she broke into our house in the middle of the night with scissors and went full Edward Scissorhands on my hair.

Tim is horrified and apologetic, but I'm struggling here. This woman violated my personal space, destroyed my hair, and acted like she was in the right. I want to go no contact with her, but Tim is stuck between me and his mom, and I feel like this is going to be a huge blowup in our marriage. Any advice? Because I'm honestly at a loss here. TL:DR: MIL cut my hair in my sleep because she thinks I'm cheating on my husband (I'm not). Now I don't know how to handle her or my marriage. Edit: My husband and I will be going to my MIL tomorrow to talk to her about the situation again. Hopefully everyone will be calmed down by then and I won't have to threaten legal action.

Earlier, I couldn't take it anymore, so I sat him down and told him he needed to be 100% honest with me about everything. That's when he dropped the bombshell. Apparently, Diane didn't come up with the haircut idea on her own. Tim admitted that he knew about it ahead of time-and even helped her. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach.

Normalize discussing access needs and wants upfront

Share links, resources, knowledge, and offer to bridge the gap between conflicting access needs.

Use plain language. Resist the idea to be perfect or put undue pressure on the most marginalized in our communities.

Say, ""I don't know"" when you don't. Be willing to learn from each other.

Allow others to contribute in the ways they see fit. Practice speaking up with others. Support where you can. Ask for support.

no one is disposable, and that includes me!

With neurodiversity? You cannot advocate for someone while using incorrect language. They do not have multiple brains. I guess if they do, that's on me. But I'm guessing they don't. 

Neurodiversity includes neurotypicals. You can't be neurotypical and Neurodivergent at the same time. 
Again, unless you have multiple brains. Again, that's on me if you do.

If you are Neurodivergent in more than one way, you still aren't ""diverse"". You're multiply Neurodivergent. 
(But of you're hiding a second brain I apologize.)

Comments will be very limited because the definition isn't up for debate. If you don't accept it, don't claim to advocate for anyone since you reject science.

You cannot be diverse by yourself. 🌈

It sort of goes along with the old adage, ""Don't cry over spilled milk."" The thing is done, you can't go back and undo it, so you had better figure out how you're going to clean up the mess. And if someone else made the mess, there's no sense in blaming them until AFTER the cleanup is done. It's important, of course, to figure all that out, and hold whoever made the mess to whatever degree of responsibility is appropriate, but trying to do so while there's still a mess on the floor doesn't get you any further towards your immediate goal - which is to clean up the mess.","1200","1600","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:6j7o3eate2dquqentbx2ej7m/bafkreifoonef4bjkz2iaspuiorivhhsg57pncowhdi4nqz2wsm6jhnnpu4@jpeg","Grasshopper speeding over a bump, moments before the servo broke.

And you will sometimes, in the course of cleaning up messes, make mistakes. You will also encounter opposition from others who complain that you're not cleaning it up the right way, or quickly enough, or whatever. It's important to realize that such comments are useless. The way to fix things is not to sit around discussing the perfect plan of action and figure out exactly how to return everything to its precise pre-mess state; you have to work quickly to stop the mess from spreading, then clean up the bulk of it, and then you can get into the minutiae.

""I have known Elon Musk at a deep level for 14 years, well before he was a household name. We used to text frequently. He would come to my birthday party and invite me to his parties. He would tell me everything about his women problems. As sons of highly accomplished men who married venuses, were violent and lost their fortunes, and who were bullied in high school, we had a number of things in common most people cannot relate to. We would hang out together late in Los Angeles. He would visit my San Diego lab. He invested in my company.

""Elon believes he is above everyone else. He used to think he worked on the most important problems. When I met him, he did not presume to be a technical person — he would be the first to say that he lacked the expertise to understand certain data. That happened later. Now, he acts as if he has all the solutions. 

All his talk about getting to Mars to “maintain the light of consciousness” or about “free speech absolutism” is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far right parties, because they are easier to control. That is also why he gave himself $56 Billion which could have gone to the people actually doing the work and innovations he is taking credit for at Tesla (the reason he does not do patents is because he would not be listed as an inventor as putting a fake inventor on a patent would kill it and moreover it would reveal the superstars behind the work).

""companies and tried to create rivals. I fired him with cause in December 2021 when he tried to undermine NV.

Elon did two Nazi salutes.

He did them for five main reasons: 

1. He was concerned that the “Nazi wing” of the MAGA movement, under the influence of Steve Bannon, would drive him away from Trump, somewhere in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, rather than in the West Wing which is where he wants to be. He was already feeling raw over the fact that Trump did not follow his recommendation for Treasury Secretary and that the Senate also did not pick his first choice;

2. He was upset that he had had to go to Israel and Auschwitz to make up for agreeing with a Nazi sympathizer online and wanted to reclaim his “power” just like when he told advertisers to “go fuck yourself”. This has nothing to do with Asperger’s;

3. There are some Jews he actually hates: Sam Altman is amongst them;

4.

""5. His narcissistic self was hoping the audience would reflect his abject gesture back to him, thereby showing complete control and dominion over it, and increasing his leverage over Trump. That did not happen. 

Bottom line: Elon is not a Nazi but he did give two Nazi Salutes, which is completely unacceptable.

N.B. For the few whining about my post “sans connaissance the cause” and either trembling about my having shattered their illusions about their cult leader or thinking I am defending Elon:

I. My point is that he is transactional rather than ideological;

II.

Plane Crash
Thanks to Elon Musk
The world's richest man apparently thought it was a good idea to bully the
Federal Aviation Administration chief out of his job.
The administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Michael
Whitaker, resigned from his position on January 20 after repeated
demands from Elon Musk that he quit, leaving the agency without a
Senate-confirmed leader during a major crisis in the wake of the D.C.
plane crash.
Musk called for Whitaker's resignation in September after the FAA chief
proposed fining Musk's company SpaceX over $600,000 in civil penalties
for failing to follow license requirements during two launches in 2023.
Whitaker told a congressional panel at the time that fines were ""the only

I first discovered what was killing these men.
I had three sons who worked with their father in the tunnel:
Cecil, aged 23, Owen, aged 21, Shirley, aged 17.
They used to work in a coal mine, not steady work for the mines were not going much of the time.
A power Co. foreman learned that we made home brew, he formed a habit of dropping in evenings to drink, persuading the boys and my husband— give up their jobs and take this other work.
It would pay them better.
Shirley was my youngest son; the boy.
He went into the tunnel.
My heart my mother my heart my mother
My heart my coming into being.
My husband is not able to work.
He has it, according to the doctor.
We have been having a very hard time making a living since this trouble came to us.
I saw the dust in the bottom of the tub.
The boy worked there about eighteen months, came home one evening with a shortness of breath.
He said, ""Mother, I cannot get my breath.""","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreic7bpvuwu53f2jjmcph2ic2s7d33yy5otpumupryvh6mkmumb4qxq@jpeg","Shirley was sick about three months.
I would carry him from his bed to the table, from his bed to the porch, in my arms.
My heart is mine in the place of hearts, They gave me back my heart, it lies in me.
When they took sick, right at the start, I saw a doctor.
I tried to get Dr. Harless to X-ray the boys.
He was the only man I had any confidence in, the company doctor in the Kopper's mine, but he would not see Shirley.
He did not know where his money was coming from.
I promised him half if he'd work to get compensation, but even then he would not do anything.
I went on the road and begged the X-ray money, the Charleston hospital made the lung pictures, he took the case after the pictures were made.
And two or three doctors said the same thing.
The youngest boy did not get to go down there with me, he lay and said, ""Mother, when I die, I want you to have them open me up and see if that dust killed me.

I have gained mastery over my heart
I have gained mastery over my two hands I have gained mastery over the waters I have gained mastery over the river.
The case of my son was the first of the line of lawsuits.
They sent the lawyers down and the doctors down; they closed the electric sockets in the camps.
There was Shirley, and Cecil, Jeffrey and Oren, Raymond Johnson, Clev and Oscar Anders, Frank Lynch, Henry Palf, Mr. Pitch, a foreman; a slim fellow who carried steel with my boys, his name was Darnell, I believe. There were many others, the towns of Glen Ferris, Alloy, where the white rock lies, six miles away; Vanetta, Gauley Bridge, Gamoca, Lockwood, the gullies, the whole valley is witness.
I hitchhike eighteen miles, they make checks out.
They asked me how I keep the cow on $2.

four.","2000","1500","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreibd7axh5qlht4kgjqo666oglpmeimpxyycm4kw2zcczn45rruwfhi@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:c3oxs65ovqmgf5uv2lzfahad/bafkreibd7axh5qlht4kgjqo666oglpmeimpxyycm4kw2zcczn45rruwfhi@jpeg","The oldest son was twenty-three.

They would pronounce it fever.
Shirley asked that we try to find out.

I open out a way, they have covered my sky with crystal I come forth by day, I am born a second time, I force a way through, and I know the gate I shall journey over the earth among the living.

You can look up the laws in your area pertaining to protests. Call the police and notify them you're exercising your legal right to protest. Ask them if they can send some officers to help with crowd control. Ask them where you can stand legally. If MAGA does anything violent, they get arrested. I know the police can be scary, but it's their job... unless they're racists that use excessive force, then disregard everything I said 😅

Honestly asking police to do crowd control never even crossed my mind.. I assumed police show up to protest just to be ready for a riot if it got big enough.. personally I don’t trust the police, but having them involved could be the reassurance needed for more people to come to the protest..

In the third inning, he removed the glasses and was preparing to proceed without them.

Those who won't take measure of their own strength, for fear of antagonizing their own weakness. Those who don't like to make waves—or enemies. Those for whom freedom, honour, truth, and principles are only literature. Those who live small, mate small, die small. It's the reductionist approach to life: if you keep it small, you'll keep it under control. If you don't make any noise, the bogeyman won't find you.

I’ve gone through a rough break up with my ex-fiancée and I’m living alone — truly by myself, no roommates, in a studio apartment — for the first time in my life. I’m generally very depressed at this point, and I decide one night, after a long stretch of sad solo dinners at home, to treat myself to a night at the movies.

Every year during the Academy Awards, when they get to the short film nominees, I tell myself “Those look good, next year I’m gonna watch all those bad boys” and then, of course, the next year comes round and the bad boys remain unwatched. But this year, in an effort to shock myself back into happiness by shaking up my routine, I take action, look up showtimes, find that my favorite walking-distance theater has some, and buy a ticket. As I walk out and head for the theater, for the first time in weeks, I’m feeling pretty okay.

I get there, get high, and head inside to settle in for the slate: all five entries are shown back-to-back in one screening that is roughly the length of a feature film. The first short is a Spanish entry called Madre, directed by Rodrigo Sorogoyen.","1290","1412","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreific5yvoswfmhvvbwlgoxkuab4ijqpjhqhjz6r25k77ofb444gaue@jpeg","(Warning: If you had any intention of watching the 2019 Oscar short films — and if you haven’t picked it up by now, I am ultimately going to recommend that you do not — then it is my duty to inform you that plot spoilers lie ahead for all five films, but the details, I’m afraid, are important.)

Madre is mostly one sustained take, wherein a young woman returns home from a shopping trip with her mother in tow, just as she’s receiving a call on her cell phone. On the other end of the call is her 6-year-old son. The boy, on vacation with his father (the woman’s estranged husband), is alone and lost on a beach.

She naturally begins asking her son questions, only some of which he is able to answer with any clarity, but which illuminate the basic details: the boy’s father and some friends took the boy on a planned surfing trip somewhere on the coast of France — or maybe Spain; the boy’s grasp of geography is still weak — but they somehow became separated and now the boy can’t find them.

Oh, also: his cell phone battery is dying.","1282","1436","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:cuha7ri3ensfsjk6q4dexvdg/bafkreihwt3pl3fan7l3kofnhhxoyhaso645kqtcehdgataticfenmmyfke@jpeg","The woman’s mother watches on from the kitchen table in agony, helpless.

The woman tells the boy to hang tight and calls the police. They aren’t much help but they tell her to come down to the station. As she’s leaving to do so, she gets another call. It’s the boy again. His battery is almost dead — but now there’s a stranger on the beach, a man, and he’s noticed the boy.

The boy says he’s scared. She tells him to run. She hears him find a hiding spot behind a rock, but it’s too late. The man spots the boy and starts approaching — when the battery dies. The call ends. The woman screams and rushes out of the apartment, and the camera lands on the horrified face of her mother.

The end.

HOOOOOOOooooooookay.

I take a deep breath. It‘s an incredibly well done piece, but Madre is a fucking fraught tale of child endangerment, expertly directed to crank the tension to maximum levels. In between films one and two, the room is kinda buzzing with energy. I enjoyed it, but I hope quietly that lighter fare is on the way.

It’s all fun and games until one boy is swallowed whole by some sort of quicksand— extremely, excruciatingly slowly — right in front of his buddy.

After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the friend flees for help. He climbs for hours over giant, dune-like heaps of gravel, in a montage reminiscent of an old-Hollywood Arabian epic, until finally being picked up by a passing motorist, a nice older woman.

When she leaves him in the car at a gas station to call for help, he begins to sob when he spots something outside the window: a frolicking fox, disappearing into the tree line.

basically i was travelling and was very anxious about it. 
so i'm in the train and at some point we get out in order to switch trains. problem, there seems to be a fuckup in the rail system so we'll have to stay in that town for like a week.
i go look for a hotel and come across one that is in a mansion, it's strangely affordable for what seems to be a pretty high-class establishment.
and i meet the owner of the place, a very charming woman
we chat for a bit and she tells me that tomorrow the hotel is organizing a sort of contest to win a seat at an establishment usually reserved for rich people (from what i remember, a sort of school) and that it was a week long.
she understands very well that i'm not a student but asks me if i would like to participate anyway seeing that i'll be staying here for some time and that it could help pass the time.
i then accept the offer.
DAY 1 :
i'm in the entrance hall with around 20 people. the owner explains the rules.
basically there's going to be a sort of social game in the hotel for the next week (think tv shows like Big Brother etc.) and that at the end of the week a winner will be chosen. there's no games or other challenges beyond that, it'll just be us interacting with each other for a week.
so no need to stress everything will be fine, and unless a big problem occurs we won't need to all be in the same room like this again.
so everyone's like okay 👍 seems fair enough
and this is how the week starts","546","914","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreif4kquzpyy3talktuijsnxnv2ku65xzs5fmw2hydpc62pt53givky@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreif4kquzpyy3talktuijsnxnv2ku65xzs5fmw2hydpc62pt53givky@jpeg","okay so
now imagine a montage to show time passing.
there's moments where i thought i saw the owner doing some sleight of hand and continuity errors in her movements throughout the hotel
one day i enter the wrong room by accident and see 2 crocodile women furry style, i think i'm hallucinating and leave the room in a hurry
the montage continues and i'm chilling with people etc.
then day 6 arrives, 2nd to last day of this event.
and there's an accident ?!
basically there's a room that has a hole in middle which shows the floor below and there's a guy that i didn't really like that fell from it
(crude mspaint drawing showing a rough representation of the room)
like this
so someone must've pushed him off the fence","647","916","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreify7blcjp6ih2upi7mjsgf443vmyrdf26jglj23d4hvstbj4fnfle@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreify7blcjp6ih2upi7mjsgf443vmyrdf26jglj23d4hvstbj4fnfle@jpeg","the owner comes to my room to tell me the news and that everyone was in that room
so i follow her there and i can see the guy from above.
then, in front of everyone she announces that i'll be kicked out of the event, potentially implying that i was the culprit.
i know i didn't do anything so i start to get really fucking angry
the reaction i had was anything but normal from me
i grab the nearest bottle of alcohol and drink, i don't finish it but make sure to empty it roughly on top of the body before throwing it at him
i take another bottle, drink, empty, throw
i take another bottle, i empty it entirely and throw it
take, empty, throw
multiple times, it goes on for a while
i'm crying the whole time, i feel betrayed
everyone's shocked, someone tries to confort me, saying that surely there's a misunderstanding
it doesn't work, i'm in a frenzy, a violent haze
and all this time the owner is silent and lets me do all that
eventually i go towards the stairs, in order to leave.
i arrive at the bottom of the stairs and the corridor in front of me shows me the body covered in broken glass and various liquids, and beyond him there's the owner walking towards the entrance hall (so she's facing away from me)
i didn't see her leave before me, that's very sus !
so i try to be stealthy and follow her
there's an intersection and instead of continuing to follow her i pause and see her spawn on my left, continuing to walk away from me. so she knew i was following her ! but i was smarter than her this time!
i continue to follow her and at some point i have a sort of catalepsy episode and fall face-first onto the floor. (it's something that happens to me in various dreams, i have my idea why but in this context its not necessary to explain it)
for context, it's like 9/10pm and i'm wearing one of my lolita dresses
eventually i hear steps coming towards me
and what a surprise, it's the owner ! and she's helping me get back up !
she asks if everything's okay in such a worried voice !","685","908","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreidrxgeazshnsgxv2ilioq4sh2jcrxtqfqatro7darzp6ucqgqj2hu@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreidrxgeazshnsgxv2ilioq4sh2jcrxtqfqatro7darzp6ucqgqj2hu@jpeg","i slowly regain my ability to move but i still need a bit of help in order to walk, and we go towards the hall
and then i see that the employees aren't human. like they didn't expect me to be here so they forgot to hide it. but strangely when they see me like this with the owner they don't even try to hide it too late. very suspicious !!!!!
anyways the owner tells me that she's not kicking me out of her establishment but only the event and that i should take a walk outside in order to sober up a bit and get my thoughts in order.
at no point do i think to say anything or confront any of them about the very strange things i'm being a witness to
so i walk out trying my best to walk normally. my eyes still red from the tears and it's dark outside and i don't have a coat.
at some point i walk in front of a group of annoying teenagers and they start making comments about me.
and shit, another catalepsy episode.
the stones are slightly wet from a small rain earlier in the day, it's cold, the teenagers are still mocking me, i can't move beyond some small spasms
eventually they leave out of discomfort.
and at some point something grabs me by the back of my dress collar
what a surprise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the owner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
at this point she's making 0 effort and even in my pitiable state i can see and understand that she's a vampire
she's making little quips like ""well well well, how did a poor little doll like you find herself so far away from her shelf?"" etc.
very mocking and proud of herself.
i don't have the strength to react. i just let her do whatever she wants. i'm tired. i'm tired of this.
she carries me somewhere and says hello to someone, another vampire who i can guess is her sister
she says ""hey, i got you a gift, it's a little doll !""
i then pass hands, they chat for a bit, i'm mentally absent
and then i woke up ! :) end of the dream !","577","936","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreigarcn2ll6y2yae7ijowy6fin472y5uaqxem2tm4gra23izbjcqga@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreigarcn2ll6y2yae7ijowy6fin472y5uaqxem2tm4gra23izbjcqga@jpeg","en",,,"4",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6d2ydy7z3e4mmyvzz46ra5y/bafkreif4kquzpyy3talktuijsnxnv2ku65xzs5fmw2hydpc62pt53givky@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I'll be okay... eventually","1","0","anyways here's a dream diary 👍","https://bsky.app/profile/bagoflenas.bsky.social/post/3li5m6vnty22o"

She had seen him, even as he hid, even as he pulled all of his shadows up close and tight she had seen him. Had anyone seen him before? He couldn’t remember, in fact…he couldn’t remember anyone at all before her.
“Mr. Shadow?” She asked, pulling the closet open and reaching a hand into its darkness. 
His darkness and he rippled, but he couldn’t answer. He didn’t have the voice she had. 
“Can’t you talk, Mr. Shadow?” Lottie asked him.
He blinked his eyes and tried to shake his head, as he had seen her do, but he was only shadow and so his glowing eyes wiggled back and forth.
“That’s okay, you don’t have to talk. Oh, do you know letters?”
He didn’t and shook his shadows again, slower, it felt…strange to not know. Like he should know, and it made him want to hide that he didn’t.
“I can teach you!” She shouted and from the tips of her toes to her lips the excitement seemed to bubble. But just as quickly as it burst, Lottie slapped her hands over her mouth and looked at the closed door of her bedroom.

Vazaroust and Kenta sit next to each other at a table, while Ketna leans on a hand looking in the distance while fidgeting with a cup.
Vazaroust: You're rather Quiet
Ketna: Yeah, I'm... torn...
Vazaroust: About?

Panel 2
Ketna: Zorn made a proposition to me, and I can't decide whether to pursue it or not.
Vazaroust: I'm concerned as to what it is about the proposition that has you conflicted

Panel 3
Ketna: So, he knows I'm... 'Abnormal' and he's very, Very interested in that. Without going into too much detail, he offered an invitation to his place for a 'Fight and Fuck', if you will. 

Panel 4
Ketna looks up thoughtfully, hand resting under chin.

Panel 1
Vazaroust: It would seem to me that the decision would be an easy one.
Ketna: Right, any sane person would think that, but no.

Panel 2
Ketna rests her head in her hands, exasperated 
Kenta: The thought has me horny as hell, and I haven't been able to stop myself from thinking about it.

Ketna's hands have switched, the one she was resting on is now on the table, the other is resting under her chin in a thoughtful expression.

The door makes a weird cracking sound, right as he realizes he should have considered that there might be someone standing behind it. But there isn't, thank god—he's alone in the bathroom, which is perfect, because he can't stand to be around any of those fuckers for a second longer. 

He goes to the sink and runs some water to splash his face. Glances at the mirror (he can never resist, even if he knows he won’t like what he sees). He looks haggard, eyes bloodshot, hair starting to escape from its elaborate updo. He’s sweated through his dress shirt, and it’s only a matter of time before it starts to soak through his purple velvet dinner jacket.

Ed nods, and sways a little on his feet, and Lucius rushes to him, not so much catching him as providing a solid surface for him to slump against. Ed rests his head on the shoulder of Lucius’s red brocade tailcoat and tries to take a slow, calming breath. It comes out a little jagged.

“Fuck off.”

“No, I’m serious. You should hear the stories Stede tells about them. Absolute dystopian shit.”

To be pushed and prodded and criticized and manipulated until I decided that there was no point in taking care of myself. “I want to be useful” / “I don’t want to be a burden” and to be completely unable to see a future in which I was older and happier… And as time passes, the worse I feel and the more untethered I become.
It’s, you know, a tenuous peace in which I always feel mildly unsafe. I forgot that at any moment that I’m not perfect, when I’m caught exposed, that I can be attacked. I forgot that if I’m just myself as I truly am, it’s not enough.
In the end, I’ve decided to live, but it still makes me uneasy. At the very least, I want to keep writing.

I'm starting to feel nervous about this costume contest. What if I mess this up somehow? I’d feel extra guilty about letting down both you and Kiran…""

*Robin puts a comforting hand on Olivia's shoulder*

Robin: ""Don't be silly Olivia, you look great in that outfit and Kiran said it is spot on. It’s just a photo shoot for right now anyways, the real contest doesn’t start for a few more hours so just relax.""

*Robin pulls Olivia in for a hug.*

Robin: “Besides, I have faith that you’ll win my love. Just do your best and perform like you always do.

*Olivia leans onto her husband’s shoulder and smiles.*

Robin: “Alright, well I’m going to go find somewhere to read but I’ll come find you when you’re done with your session okay? See you in a few.”

While Olivia attends her photo shoot, Robin cracks open a book he borrowed from Kiran concerning his wife’s outfit and the figure she is dressed as.

Robin: “Let’s see here, Servants of the Grail Wars... 5th Edition… Alright I need to find the chapter on the Rider, Medusa…""","2000","934","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreia6j6cfnnm6lprplve3zu5k2gknurdoo6w2ida5tdqewpanjtmely@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreia6j6cfnnm6lprplve3zu5k2gknurdoo6w2ida5tdqewpanjtmely@jpeg","As Olivia was finishing her photo session, she felt a strange sensation start to flow through her body. It shocked her so much that she tossed aside her weapon and her mask popped right off… but why would it do that? It was almost like it didn’t fit anymore…

Olivia: “What?! What was that just now? Am I… getting taller?”

In a tent next door, Robin is reading away.

Robin: “Hmmm now let’s see here… data on the Rider, Medusa…”

Oliva: *Definitely growing now but is too nervous to speak.*

Back to Robin.

Robin: “Huh, Medusa eventually became a 172ft tall creature known as the Gorgon? I’ve never heard of such a thing before… At full length she is 328ft tall from head to tail…”

The photo team seems to have fled in fear as Olivia continued to grow larger.

Olivia: “Oh why am I still getting bigger!? There isn’t any room left! I’m going to break through the tent at this rate...”

A loud series of rips and tears can be heard as well as a few crashing sounds next door.

Robin: “Okay what is all of that commotion? Is that coming from the photo tent?”

Just then a large and familiar looking boot crashed through the cloth exterior of the tent, knocking Robin flat on his butt before he became buried under a pile of rubble and debris.","2000","860","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreifux3wj2eponnmalzka75ytu4e7ru4r4ov3xp3losbh2euru57bze@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreifux3wj2eponnmalzka75ytu4e7ru4r4ov3xp3losbh2euru57bze@jpeg","Once the ordinarily fairly small woman outgrew two tents worth of space and had her expanding body smash through a few other structures at the festival, Olivia looked around nervously.

Olivia:”As if I wasn’t already worried about today as is… now I’m huge and the contest will be canceled for sure…”

Just then Olivia’s body got bigger with one final spurt.

Olivia: “And evidently it can still get worse… Please just let this be over…”

Thankfully for the dressed up dancer it was and after a minute or two of non-growth, she rose to her feet to take in her full new size to assess the damage she had accidentally caused.

Olivia: “I suppose I've stopped growing now after all… is it possible that this has something to do with the Medusa? Either way, I hope everyone down there is doing alright... Robin! Anyone! Are you all okay?”

From under a pile of partially destroyed stuff, a recognizable arm poked out with at thumbs up.

Robin: “MMMhmmmph Hmmmph Hmmm.”

Apparently Olivia’s outfit was such a perfect replication of Medusa that the forces that be gave the dancer the same size of Medusa's Gorgon form to match… At least with that… boost… she was able to win the costume contest by a landslide.","2000","790","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreibrq66p6a5coajqziilttgwpmiahfj2gz6tos2e2ixbpd2pnwhm74@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreibrq66p6a5coajqziilttgwpmiahfj2gz6tos2e2ixbpd2pnwhm74@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"6",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ytjp33xqwnte5hlcmqfyw2wi/bafkreia6j6cfnnm6lprplve3zu5k2gknurdoo6w2ida5tdqewpanjtmely@jpeg?f=.jpeg","I'll be okay... eventually","1","1","I forgot to reupload this older set of Olivia dressed up like Medusa (Rider) a few days ago for lunar new year.

Seven Pages

Page One: (5 Panels)

Panel 1- Establishing the scene is the image of the city from overhead, with a massive building with a screen on it in view.

            Caption
Mega City, Year 20XX.

Panel 2- Closer in on the city, now showing a town square. One place shows an electronic store, one TV behind the screen has “BREAKING NEWS!” on it.

	Reporter’s voice, from the TV
Citizens of Mega City, we have breaking news! 

The whole of the downtown area is under lockdown, as a rogue Robot Master is on a rampage!

Panel 3- The TV screen serves as a panel, showing the Chun-Li reference reporter, gesturing to a picture of Proto Man.

	Reporter
A spree of thefts, including of the precious Ruby Spheres from the city’s museum, has been conducted by Proto Man.

A number of eye witnesses have spotted him during each crime and were barely able to escape. It remains to be seen if he is under Dr. Wily’s control, but law enforcement is now engaging him.

Panel 4- The panel now shows a cop hitting the building from panel 2’s brick wall, a scorch mark on his shoulder from the Proto Buster blast. 

	Cop
	Gah…

	Reporter
Our only hope is that everyone remains cautious. Though Proto Man is only one robot, he is armed and dangerous.

Panel 5- “Proto Man” is shown standing on top of a car, the sun to his back, his buster is emitting smoke to signal he’s freshly fired a shot. There should be visual indicators this is ‘Copy Man’

	Reporter (off panel)
	We can only hope someone puts a stop to this and fast.

	Who are you, really? Dark Man?

Panel 3 - Shows “Proto Man” surprised.

	“Proto Man”
	Huh…I guess I overplayed the part.

Panel 4 - Mega Man has his buster ready, but isn’t pointing it, his hand is reaching out as he tries to reason.

	Mega Man
	We don’t have to fight. I’m sure we can talk this out before things get worse.

Panel 5 - “Proto Man” fires a shot, which Mega Man jumps out of the way of. His face now focused, Mega Man is ready.

Ahh, it feels good to stretch my legs at last.”

“Uh huh. Man, my neck is sore.”

“Let's hurry up and go inside. I’ll give you a massage after we’re both showered.”

“…I’ll hold you to it.”

You and Caleb walk up to the motel room door. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean and it's a place to sleep for the night. The two of you have been driving in shifts all day long, and Caleb, who both started and finished the trip, looks a little worse for the wear.

As you watch him walk to the bathroom, you purse your lips at the way he holds the back of his neck and rolls his head. You didn't think to pack any massage oil, but…digging around your bag, you emerge with some lotion. Better than nothing, you decide, and set it on the nightstand. You strip down to your underwear and scroll idly on your phone as you wait.

Caleb emerges from the bathroom in a cloud of steam, towel slung low on his hips and another draped over his head.","1354","1079","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ey3cvwd2wa5sx7ureydskvkh/bafkreiev2vnc6wzebhewa5e2o5k33j4wdzi44iubq5xyeis3efcely7s4y@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ey3cvwd2wa5sx7ureydskvkh/bafkreiev2vnc6wzebhewa5e2o5k33j4wdzi44iubq5xyeis3efcely7s4y@jpeg","“Come on,” you say, rolling over and patting the middle of the bed. “Face down, but make sure you can still breathe, okay?”

He mumbles something incomprehensible, and flops down, sending you bouncing. You kind of doubt his ability to breathe with a faceful of pillow in the way, but…well, that’s his problem, not yours. You fling a leg over his back and straddle him, settling in on his lower back. Lotion in hand, you reach out for his neck.

“Like this?”

“Mmngh…yeah.”

“What about over here?”

“…Yeah, there too.”","970","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ey3cvwd2wa5sx7ureydskvkh/bafkreiace5otg756nih5oskljidx7krunynsddscxkynzdcqtmh5hvl3ym@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:ey3cvwd2wa5sx7ureydskvkh/bafkreiace5otg756nih5oskljidx7krunynsddscxkynzdcqtmh5hvl3ym@jpeg","“How about—here?”

When you ask for feedback, you press yourself flat along his back, breasts squishing against his muscles, to put your ear by his mouth and hear what he mumbles into the pillow.

The longer you work, the more distracted you get. Your hands glide along shower-heated skin, skimming the smooth planes of his back, feeling the twitch and shift of well-developed muscles under your fingertips. Surreptitiously, you rock back and forth, grinding your clit into his lower back, your rapidly-dampening panties the only barrier between the two of you. Every grunt and groan you coax out of him only makes you clench around nothing.

Eventually, it's more than you can bear. “Caleb,” you whine, “turn over for me?”

“Mm?

Everyone tells Wriothesley it’ll be the happiest day of his life, but in the week leading up to the date, he’s a nervous wreck. There’s so much to do, there’s so much to keep in order, and there’s the lingering anxiety that maybe something will go terribly wrong. The cake won’t be the right flavor, the photographer will cancel on them, the flowers won’t get delivered in time, Neuvillette will decide that, no, actually, he’d rather get married to Itto in the end.

Wriothesley is keenly aware that he’s being an absolute moron about the whole thing, but that awareness does absolutely nothing for him. Even Navia calls him out on it, fondly exasperated. “You’re freaking out about nothing,” she tells him, and that helps for maybe five minutes before he returns to freaking out again.

His suit might not fit. He could lose one of his shoes. Maybe it snows so much that they have to cancel the whole damn thing. Neuvillette wanted the winter wedding so they didn’t have to wait until the following spring-slash-summer, and Wriothesley had agreed, but now Wriothesley sees all the ways in which everything could go completely fucking wrong.","1600","1400","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:3iw3mcimpvahnxuices7zp2h/bafkreihxeltgdmkua4jwyfb7vkemqv32x7valfm2lwrp3jm3zqm2naauvm@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:3iw3mcimpvahnxuices7zp2h/bafkreihxeltgdmkua4jwyfb7vkemqv32x7valfm2lwrp3jm3zqm2naauvm@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"30",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:3iw3mcimpvahnxuices7zp2h/bafkreihu3tzgyfgl3cqrm3pi7uxbnuddfhzmbc2kszbensf55gvrhwyjvi@jpeg?f=.jpeg","anxiety","4","12","The Finer Points of Control, ch14—Wedding bells fill the air, vows are exchanged, and a honeymoon is had.

Wanna eat what Yuyu’s eating? Here’s how I made it!
You’ll need 
- 4 boxes of macaroni and cheese 
- 1 stick of butter
- 1 cup (250 mL) of milk (i just pour it in the pot and eye ball it, so there might be more or less)
- Seasonings of your choice (Salt, Pepper, Garlic powder, whadever you use)
- 1 Ground Meat
- Half of an onion
- Barbecue Sauce
- Diced Tomato (there’s clearly not any in this photo, tho. I ran out.. so, I used ketchup instead!)
- Water to boil noodle with
- butter or cooking oil to put on the pan


Basically, follow whatever instructions the macaroni boxes say.
While waiting for the water to boil, you can start cooking the meat! Cook it in a pan at medium or low heat, make sure to put butter or oil on the pan fire tho. If you have a lid for the pan, you should put it on the pan too.
After putting the meat in the pan, you can start cutting the onion! A full onion is a bit much, so I recommend cutting it in half first. Chop the onion until you think it’s good, then put it in the pan with the meat. Make sure to mix and stir the meat and onion with a spatula or something to separate the meat.
When the water boils, add the noodles, and wait for both the noodles and meat to finish cooking.
When the noodles finish, pour out the water, and see if the meat is cooked.
When the meat is cooked, and if the noodles have had the water poured out, add the meat to the pot with the noodles.
Add the stick of butter and milk to the same pot, and stir it around until the butter melts. Then add the cheese packets, seasonings, tomatoes, and maybe barbecue sauce if you wanted to add it.
Mix it together well, and it should be done when you think it’s all mixed!

I wanna see that. 2) I notice they enforce helmet rules in the Mall Car, very funny unless you think abt how its bc they would not have doctors for an injury. 3) Imagine Apex board game nights… Simon gets too competitive and is only allowed to ref. 4) Nights at the Apex are hectic, only Grace and Simon have their own rooms so for the kids its basically a big sleepover. There is often a mix of people trying to sleep vs. those people who will talk and talk. 5) the kids like to make guesses over what Train car they will see next. 6) they have random celebration days for birthdays and holidays bc what is time on the Train

user alysurr: I love the idea that they play like competitive sports (like rollerblade hockey) and stuff in the mall and have like a running score going.

started with loads of inspiration, followed by an acute depressive episode, then quite productive summer, into autumn and winter which made me feel exceptionally like shit

i can tell ive become more grumpy, i can tell i tend to avoid any human interaction, even virtually, for which i sincerely apologise. im sorry that i was this absent recently. or ever. im sorry.

in the last 2 months ive felt exceptionally awful. and it's still holding on and not willing to release. not that anything tragic had happened... which arguably is even more deeply concerning. but i feel like it's this constant force pressing me down. and it's heavy. it's strong. and i fucking hate it.

really sorry that ive worded it this way, it's just... i dont even know what that is... again, im sorry. im aware this wont change a lot, but nevertheless.

on the upside, during the inspiration wave i've made some of my favourite music ever. of course, it's far from being released, but still. and the recent noisevember was also a nice challenge. ive sharpened my programming skills during summer, i even learnt vim. so i cant objectively say that it's been all bad, im just in a bad headspace.

and thank you, yes you. just for being there. i know this is more that i can ask for but still. i wish i could give something back in return.

i just hope 2025 will be if not better, at least less bad.

again, sorry for a bit of a negative rant
and thank you for sticking around <3

Gottschalk: Ich hatte kein sexuelles Interesse an den Spice Girls. Sie waren in den Neunzigern des vergangenen Jahrhunderts bei mir zu Gast und haben auch an mir rumgezerrt. Außerdem haben die doch gesungen: »If you wanna be my lover«.

SPIEGEL: Der Songtext war sicherlich keine Einladung zum Anfassen.

Gottschalk: Ich habe Frauen im TV rein dienstlich angefasst. Wie ein Schauspieler, der im Film küsst, weil es im Drehbuch steht. Das lasse ich mir nicht als Attacke vorwerfen. Trotzdem würde ich das heute bleiben lassen, weil ich weiß, dass gewisse Dinge mittlerweile politisch inkorrekt sind, die es damals nicht waren. Ich betrete heute auch keinen Aufzug mehr, in dem nur eine Frau steht. Was mache ich, wenn sie im zweiten Stock rausrennt und ruft: »#MeToo, der hat mich angefasst!«?

SPIEGEL: Das Erste, was Ihnen zu #MeToo einfällt, sind Falschbezichtigungen? Sie reden damit Übergriffe gegen Frauen klein.

The Xman Rouge is doing her grab move on Roll from megaman
but ummm uhh the grab move is a kiss on the lips
This is something I'm sure we saw while playing this in childhood but its been years...over a decade at least since we even touched this game before playing it last week. and before we kinda just kept our ""i feel funny"" feelings to ourself...well that ship has sailed!

cause damn i wanna be roll and damn i want rouge to be my big sis haha

The interaction is really interesting to me not just because of its novelty but after watching the recent Xmen cartoon in which rouge has a story arc about how she's off and on again with magneto (bc his powers allow for her to experience physical intimacy with him without hurting him. 
it makes me think that since Roll is a robot little girl and wont die from this Rouge might see this as a new opportunity for connection :3

RM ""Come back to me""

When RM stepped out onto the stage at fellow BTS member Suga’s August 2023 solo concert in Seoul’s KSPO Dome, most people expected him to perform a song from his 2022 album Indigo, or perhaps a rap-driven track from BTS’ immense discography. Instead, he turned down the lights, stood alone on the massive stage, and growled his way through a raw, unreleased track about the divinity of life’s heartbreaks. The performance traded in the stage surety that pop superstardom grants RM in favor of something far more fragile. It was incredibly powerful to watch, even more so because RM himself seemed unsure of the nascent track’s reception.","1831","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreigwn7sgltc5f3f4r3dqqf3ikxdzgag4wsdfoqmexcmsvl7b3rnn6y@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreigwn7sgltc5f3f4r3dqqf3ikxdzgag4wsdfoqmexcmsvl7b3rnn6y@jpeg","The song would eventually be released as “Come back to me,” a lead single off of RM’s 2024 studio album Right Place, Wrong Person. Like much of the rest of RPWP, the song is a departure from both the diverse music RM has written for BTS and from the hip-hop he has tended to favor as a mode of expression in his solo output thus far. “Come back to me” includes none of Kim Namjoon’s signature rap, demonstrating another level of vulnerability for an artist who could never try anything sonically new for the rest of his life and still die a rich and revered musical visionary.","1293","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreiasp7u6dhvqikfy4gi6yeexhdz2j5m5adt6vdaw6m3tymeevfyeiy@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreiasp7u6dhvqikfy4gi6yeexhdz2j5m5adt6vdaw6m3tymeevfyeiy@jpeg","In a K-pop era where most songs don’t even make it to the three-minute mark, “Come back to me” is gloriously meandering. Like the theme of weary searching explored in the “Come back to me”’s lyrics, the track’s structure wanders, committing first to hushed, spoken vocals over gentle guitar and muted percussion (“I forgot the hour / I don’t wanna know ’bout the hour / I forgot to shower / Even washing my face feels like a waste of time”) before transitioning to a fuller, though no less laidback instrumental more than halfway in. The trend-resistant track sweeps the listener up with RM’s declaration of pain as exquisitely necessary, bringing us out with a mantra of cathartic acceptance: “You are my pain, divine divine.”","1583","1080","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreigctoa3tcsullzg7ntzqc3nsbohxrmywywwltuzlmvkt33zh7qwk4@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreigctoa3tcsullzg7ntzqc3nsbohxrmywywwltuzlmvkt33zh7qwk4@jpeg",,,,,,"en",,,"24",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:2zngxh2qhrrhgmavm27f4qkt/bafkreigwn7sgltc5f3f4r3dqqf3ikxdzgag4wsdfoqmexcmsvl7b3rnn6y@jpeg?f=.jpeg","wanna die","0","6","Paste Magazine names ""Come back to me"" as one of the best K-Pop songs of 2024.

Once the canary showed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning the door would be closed and a valve opened, allowing oxygen from the tank on top to be released and revive the canary. The miners would then be expected to evacuate the danger area.

So why is this my favourite object in our collections? Firstly, while I don’t advocate the use of animals in testing dangerous conditions, I am pleased that Haldane spared a thought for the canaries themselves and worked to make their job as non-lethal as possible. My impression from hearing about canaries in coal mines was that they were expected to die to warn people, so when I came across this object it was a huge relief (though my research on the topic has found less thoughtful cages).

I’ve even read that many miners cared deeply for their canary companions, and some disliked the advent of electronic sensors in the mid-1980s because it meant they would lose this companionship. Personally, I’m pleased that this practice has come to an end.","708","963","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:di3xrpx4l3bsgmktdirfsxcv/bafkreiaz4prtduzxvhytg2u2kr6qjhozrnu4gnlswoyivahgnqgpu6dhfa@jpeg","https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:di3xrpx4l3bsgmktdirfsxcv/bafkreiaz4prtduzxvhytg2u2kr6qjhozrnu4gnlswoyivahgnqgpu6dhfa@jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"en",,,"7",,,,,"https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:di3xrpx4l3bsgmktdirfsxcv/bafkreiaz4prtduzxvhytg2u2kr6qjhozrnu4gnlswoyivahgnqgpu6dhfa@jpeg?f=.jpeg","wanna die","1","1","(for anyone who doesn't wanna read a ton, here's the meat of the story)","https://bsky.app/profile/glassbottommeg.bsky.social/post/3lbdr6kdbk223"
