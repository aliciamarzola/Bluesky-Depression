I wanna die but also i want to live,1
"In an overly sentimental and depressive mood as of late. I wish I had more people to talk about it with sometimes, but I know that my best medicine is to withdraw and process these emotions alone.",1
"Cronic insomnia, man. I don't recommend it. Total memory collapse and suicidal thoughts. The only thing that stays with you daily is the complete feeling of despair. On the plus side, I don't remember much of it.",1
"I spent decades not ovulating and having a period once a year, courtesy of PCOS. I started smoking weed, and magically all of that resolved - but let me discover that when my body works correctly I have PMDD, which makes me batshit insane.

Woke up to intrusive suicidal thoughts this morning. Fun.",1
I haven't wanted to die in years but now my suicidal thoughts are returning because of this election.,1
"No hope left, am completely financially screwed, SSD is taking forever, I really can't do this anymore. I wanna crawl into a hole and die",1
god i wish i was dead,1
"Me: I’m depressed. I actively have suicidal thoughts 

People around me: have you ever thought about losing weight?",1
"I feel empty and dead inside.
HaH another random ass shower though.
It's fine, I'm fine.",1
"I really hate myself for this. I have breakdowns at work, days where I can’t do anything, I have suicidal thoughts, I hate myself and then when I have one mildly okay experience I’m convinced I’m a fraud.",1
"Corny things are the way I distract myself from suicidal thoughts, but I've been doing it for too long, which makes my brain associate them together. Now my corny feelings and suicidal thoughts come together, and that's so annoying because if I let the corny feelings out all it left is the bad stuff",1
got too stressed out then suicidal thoughts kicked in. cant mentally do anything except lying down with shortness of breath and felt asleep during it.,1
"Yesterday I had serious thoughts about planning a suicide attempt and now that I am less suicidal I am scared, concerned, overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do.",1
"Okay maybe I should get help. But honestly, nobody can help me anyway. Those suicidal thoughts are not going to stop unless everything about me changes.",1
"they say these are the golden years 
but I wish that I could disappear",1
"I just hate my life. 
I hope something will end my life any day.",1
"I'm never going to enjoy or be apart of art my friends get to, and it makes me so fucking mad, I'm so envious I hate myself so much. I'm doing nothing am nothing I'm legit, I'm worthless in every single way. I'm never going to get better I'm fucked it'd be easier if I died, why am I suck a fuck up..",1
"I love when I get ignored so much lately I have to fucking stop talking in general and having suicidal thoughts 

yeah I rather just do it I’m tired of my own self, I don’t have any purpose being here because I’m just a fucking toy to everyone",1
I'm not dead even tho I wish I was,1
Wellbutrin gave me suicidal thoughts so of course it comes as a rope.,1
Not even been back to work a week and I wish I was dead again  normal,1
"sometimes I wanna die
I don’t care if it’s sad I want to die",1
today is a big “i hate everyone and everything and i wish i was dead” day,1
I am becoming suicidal now.  I worked for my SS and Medicare for 52 years.  How are we sitting back and letting this happen?,1
"Don't worry. As you claw back something, those thoughts start to get more quiet.  I have dealt with suicidal thoughts my whole life too, and I now use their frequency as a measure of how bad I am mentally. They do get easier to manage as patterns change",1
"I feel that way with my business often and I can tell you it’s a really empty feeling. Really bad my guys. Kind of combo of  imposter syndrome , self loathing and feeling unworthy of social interaction. Awful awful feeling. Inside and outwardly.",1
"i dont know what i do
i just wanna kms cuz i dont feel comfortable being alive, I WANT TO MAKE MUSIC",1
"As a person with suicidal thoughts, I know what it feels like.

",1
"I need to sleep, it is 4am and i wanna die",1
"Also! Suicidal ideation! 
I mention it every time because having grown up with seriously depressed/suicidal family members, I knew I wasn't, but got the fun time intrusive thoughts. (Microdose of lithium cleared it up for me, but see your doc).",1
"I need to get a journal so I can write all the dumb, depressive, and jealous thoughts down, then scrunch them up and throw them in the trash where they belong.",1
lying in bed feeling neglected and hurt and wishing for death because being suicidal is apparently the only response I know to negative emotions and thoughts,1
I wish I could disappear from my job for 6 months and no one notice…,1
I just want everything to stop for long enough to get my feet back under me. I feel like I've been scrambling nonstop the past 24 months and getting nowhere. I need a chance to catch up without everything else careening further away.,1
the feeling of wanting to disappear,1
"[Depression]

Oof, here come the suicidal thoughts. Let’s try turning the human off and back on again, goodnight!

(I’m safe, just not enjoying the inside of my brain)",1
"Perhaps it helps other people, but as someone who struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts I truly do not like suicide hotline information being spammed everywhere.

It reminds me of my mental health struggles while I am enjoying something else and actually makes me feel worse",1
It's been a long time since I've had one as bad as the one I had earlier today. My head hurts from crying so much & I just wanna curl up & d*e. Fuck everything.,1
wish I could find a way to disappear,1
"I just hate my life. 
I hope something will end my life any day.",1
Wish I could just disappear,1
I wish I was dead. I’m so exhausted,1
"Money is only one part of the equation, and with how things are now, it'd be......emotionally meaningless, I guess. Less acute stress, but I'd still feel empty inside.

I'm just so tired and tired of crying. And the people I live w/aren't used to dealing with my emotions, so it only helps so much.",1
"normally i have regular suicidal thoughts but today its like ""dude itd be so fuckin cool to press one of these against my temple""",1
yeah id kill myself tbf not becauss of you but because i suffer from severe suicidal ideation suicide affects many households a year if you or anyone you know is suffering from suicidal thoughts please pick up the phone and call (248) 434-5508 you are NOT alone,1
"Gonna slap a TW on this for talk about suicidal thoughts

I’m not doing very good lately; I rarely am this time of year. I’m sticking around and it’ll pass, it always does.",1
I can’t do this anymore. It’s too much. I can’t deal with this constant depression and all these suicidal thoughts. I want all this pain to end.,1
I want to disappear from the public eye forever uughhhhh I wish I could just stay at home all day I don't wanna go to college! I don't wanna be perceived!!!,1
Like speedrunning suicidal thoughts what the fuck man,1
"5th day not cutting, im getting constant suicidal thoughts, i still cant cut cause i have no money to buy a new knife",1
ironically i hate myself too much to end my life. feels like i don't deserve that mercy,1
This day hasn’t had an hour that passed without me having suicidal thoughts. Cool.,1
"i have literally had a depression diagnosis since july 2015, and not once has a medical professional thought how i interact with depressing/suicidal thoughts as weird or unusual. like that part kindof flabergasts me... i have used depressive spirals/episodes as a descriptor since 2019... the fuck?",1
I have this problem with overwhelming suicidal thoughts and i just want it to stop,1
Some days I wish I could disappear,1
"I wish I could just disappear and leave every feeling behind… every failure, every pain…
When I was younger I wished I could succeed in a art career… but being denied art academy at your age really struck me in the wrong way…
Now I’m a soulless being… without anything valuable in my life…",1
I don't wish BPD on anyone... 1 small thing and I absolutely wish I was dead.,1
im just kms i dont care about making money or being thin anymore i just wanna die i dont care anymore nothing matters,1
Peak midnight suicidal rambling hours sorry,1
"Even if I get shit figured out, I'm still gonna wanna kms again in a year or so, is it really worth it to work hard if I'll just feel worse again?",1
"Marks auntie passed away late last week and it's just sinking in. Add that to the stress and worry I'm feeling at the moment and I just wanna dissappear 

Trying to snap outta this but it's not shifting.
Gonna crawl into bed, watch TV and have an early night.",1
"Woof this is a mood. I call mine “suicidal ideation man”. May not work for everyone but it helps me. If he strikes when I’m stuck in an inconvenient situation I can just “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” until the worst of it passes. 
It’s such an energy-drain to deal with these thoughts all the time.",1
Acknowledging that I'm probably gonna die a lonely POS should give me clarity or peace but it mostly just makes me wanna self-destruct quicker,1
"Like I just did a good ten half sentences, because I had to stop myself from continuing my thoughts cuz they were suicidal or self deprecating",1
The reason this came up for me is that I recently shared what my depressive/suicidal/self-loathing thoughts are like with my sister for the first time. And she subsequently admitted to me that she simply cannot relate because she doesn’t have that voice. Or any voice really. And it feels so strange,1
"TW Suicide:

As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my life, I get it. Today is rough as hell for everyone's mental health. I won't lie, I've had those thoughts in the past 24hrs but I'm not useful in the fight to get our rights back if I'm dead

Take care of yourself please.",1
dint know that stopping adderall can cause EVEN MORE depression :mmm:  no wonder i’ve been in a depressive episode,1
"TW: Suicide



The depression is bad tonight. I'm getting suicidal thoughts - the feeing that I can't do anything right, I'm wrong about everything, I can't even look after Marmite properly. It's all shit.",1
And I just feel like ending it so bad because of the way people treat me I try to be a good person but all people do is hurt me. I get attached to someone they replace me. I’m tired of this world and the people inside it. I really am. These past few days I’ve been really suicidal. And I had thoughts,1
I'm tired of being a burden... I want to be better... But I don't know how...,1
I can't keep shitposting. I have to dissociate and cry instead. My stomach hurts all the time now and I wish I was dead all the time.,1
i feel so fucking dumb posting these su!cidal posts on my alt but if i don’t get these thoughts out right now i will try my hardest to make sure i don’t see tmrw. don’t care how but i will figure it out SO i’m posting my feelings for the internet to see lmfao. hahahahaa i wanna die,1
"been relapsing and having suicidal thoughts and im not really sure what to do about it
