"In an overly sentimental and depressive mood as of late. I wish I had more people to talk about it with sometimes, but I know that my best medicine is to withdraw and process these emotions alone.",1
Happy Tuesday y'all! I'm so tired today lol!,1
love that I’m at the point of mental illness where when my brain is screaming at me that all life is pointless that translates as a whoopsie big sads,1
"Cronic insomnia, man. I don't recommend it. Total memory collapse and suicidal thoughts. The only thing that stays with you daily is the complete feeling of despair. On the plus side, I don't remember much of it.",1
"I spent decades not ovulating and having a period once a year, courtesy of PCOS. I started smoking weed, and magically all of that resolved - but let me discover that when my body works correctly I have PMDD, which makes me batshit insane.

Woke up to intrusive suicidal thoughts this morning. Fun.",1
"Think about this the next time you're voting for this hate @padilla.senate.gov. I have battled chronic suicidal thoughts my entire life, in no small part bc of transphobia in this country. If they win, I'm not going out quietly. People will see it happen. www.independent.co.uk/news/world/a...",1
I haven't wanted to die in years but now my suicidal thoughts are returning because of this election.,1
"No hope left, am completely financially screwed, SSD is taking forever, I really can't do this anymore. I wanna crawl into a hole and die",1
god i wish i was dead,1
"smacking myself in the face a few times to try and push myself to Be Interested in things again lest the depressive bad thoughts continue to take hold yet again

no you stupid idiot going into a depressive fog and shutting yourself out from your friends will NOT make you feel better",1
"I feel empty and dead inside.
HaH another random ass shower though.
It's fine, I'm fine.",1
"I really hate myself for this. I have breakdowns at work, days where I can’t do anything, I have suicidal thoughts, I hate myself and then when I have one mildly okay experience I’m convinced I’m a fraud.",1
"Corny things are the way I distract myself from suicidal thoughts, but I've been doing it for too long, which makes my brain associate them together. Now my corny feelings and suicidal thoughts come together, and that's so annoying because if I let the corny feelings out all it left is the bad stuff",1
got too stressed out then suicidal thoughts kicked in. cant mentally do anything except lying down with shortness of breath and felt asleep during it.,1
"Yesterday I had serious thoughts about planning a suicide attempt and now that I am less suicidal I am scared, concerned, overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do.",1
I feel humiliation and shame.,1
"they say these are the golden years 
but I wish that I could disappear",1
"I just hate my life. 
I hope something will end my life any day.",1
"I'm never going to enjoy or be apart of art my friends get to, and it makes me so fucking mad, I'm so envious I hate myself so much. I'm doing nothing am nothing I'm legit, I'm worthless in every single way. I'm never going to get better I'm fucked it'd be easier if I died, why am I suck a fuck up..",1
"I love when I get ignored so much lately I have to fucking stop talking in general and having suicidal thoughts 

yeah I rather just do it I’m tired of my own self, I don’t have any purpose being here because I’m just a fucking toy to everyone",1
I'm not dead even tho I wish I was,1
Wellbutrin gave me suicidal thoughts so of course it comes as a rope.,1
Not even been back to work a week and I wish I was dead again  normal,1
today is a big “i hate everyone and everything and i wish i was dead” day,1
"Hey mutuals, if you see me disappear for a couple weeks, the most likely reason is that I got sent to a mental hospital.

I'm starting to notice that I'm turning into more of a monster. My outbursts and suicidal thoughts have been more common and I'm running out of friends

Thanks for understanding.",1
I've never had like... suicidal thoughts before but they've come up enough times to the point where I think I need to speak with someone about it,1
I am becoming suicidal now.  I worked for my SS and Medicare for 52 years.  How are we sitting back and letting this happen?,1
"Don't worry. As you claw back something, those thoughts start to get more quiet.  I have dealt with suicidal thoughts my whole life too, and I now use their frequency as a measure of how bad I am mentally. They do get easier to manage as patterns change",1
"Yeah. <3 I'm pretty sure I can get most of it back and restart what I can't

But it's still a pretty big blow to my mental health ngl. I'll be okay eventually but I'm too tired rn.",1
"I feel that way with my business often and I can tell you it’s a really empty feeling. Really bad my guys. Kind of combo of  imposter syndrome , self loathing and feeling unworthy of social interaction. Awful awful feeling. Inside and outwardly.",1
I’m so fucking tired of beating myself down for the sake of others just for them to sit on my bloodied corpse.,1
"i dont know what i do
i just wanna kms cuz i dont feel comfortable being alive, I WANT TO MAKE MUSIC",1
"As a person with suicidal thoughts, I know what it feels like.

",1
"I’m sorry to hear that as well. It’s a very strange feeling for sure. I thought about her a fair bit, but basically it was as if she was already gone… but now that she really is gone… it’s just really sad.",1
i just realized i can't remember what her voice sounds like and now i feel so numb,1
"I'm basically non-functional without adderall (not to mention how it helps my anxiety) and my depression is... manageable with an SSRI. 

I've struggled hard with suicidal thoughts and self-harming and for the first time I'm not okay but I'm better than I was. 

Fuck this fucking ghoul.",1
"I need to sleep, it is 4am and i wanna die",1
"I need to get a journal so I can write all the dumb, depressive, and jealous thoughts down, then scrunch them up and throw them in the trash where they belong.",1
lying in bed feeling neglected and hurt and wishing for death because being suicidal is apparently the only response I know to negative emotions and thoughts,1
"i really do feel like if i disappeared no one would notice or care lol 

not doing well, but i won't keep whining",1
Everything always feels like it's getting worse and I don't think I'll ever be free I just want to escape but it's bigger and faster and stronger it always catches me at a certain point I just have to stop running at a certain point I have to look the beast in its eyes and greet it with open arms,1
the feeling of wanting to disappear,1
"[Depression]

Oof, here come the suicidal thoughts. Let’s try turning the human off and back on again, goodnight!

(I’m safe, just not enjoying the inside of my brain)",1
Legit I think I should kill myself bro we ain’t making it to a happy ending I can’t even manage to feel okay.,1
"Perhaps it helps other people, but as someone who struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts I truly do not like suicide hotline information being spammed everywhere.

It reminds me of my mental health struggles while I am enjoying something else and actually makes me feel worse",1
It's been a long time since I've had one as bad as the one I had earlier today. My head hurts from crying so much & I just wanna curl up & d*e. Fuck everything.,1
wish I could find a way to disappear,1
i feel like when you've hated yourself and had suicidal thoughts for as long as you can remember it's not hard to find things to be envious of in others  and its hard to imagine letting go of those feelings,1
I’m so fucking tired of goyim weaponizing antisemitism claims.,1
"I just hate my life. 
I hope something will end my life any day.",1
"The truth is that I haven't been very well, I fell into a depressive episode again and the thoughts of disappearing returned. When I went back to therapy, Pandora's box was opened and it has been very difficult for me to heal parts of my past that I thought were already resolved.",1
Wish I could just disappear,1
I wish I was dead. I’m so exhausted,1
"Money is only one part of the equation, and with how things are now, it'd be......emotionally meaningless, I guess. Less acute stress, but I'd still feel empty inside.

I'm just so tired and tired of crying. And the people I live w/aren't used to dealing with my emotions, so it only helps so much.",1
"And all I wanna do is dissappear and start over somewhere new, and happy, but that's just not feasible.  I'll be strong and I'll continue to survive,  but how long am I meant to struggle, because so far the universe STILL hasn't been kind to me. I'm so tired. Thanks for listening yall. Ur all I got.",1
I'm so tired of being alone. I'm tired of feeling no one would notice if I disappeared.,1
"Gonna slap a TW on this for talk about suicidal thoughts

I’m not doing very good lately; I rarely am this time of year. I’m sticking around and it’ll pass, it always does.",1
i dont wanna die but i do at the same time im stuck in some limbo where im tied to people but so disconnected from myself. i dont see the point anymore. i just wanna feel like myself again but all i can do is push people away it seems. i think thats what im good at its fine i’ll keep going for you,1
having a lot of pain so i'm going to have to stop drawing for the night because i can't sit up at all. trying not to feel frustrated because it's not like i didn't get anything done today. i just didn't get as much done as i'd hoped to. ah well.,1
I can’t do this anymore. It’s too much. I can’t deal with this constant depression and all these suicidal thoughts. I want all this pain to end.,1
I want to disappear from the public eye forever uughhhhh I wish I could just stay at home all day I don't wanna go to college! I don't wanna be perceived!!!,1
ironically i hate myself too much to end my life. feels like i don't deserve that mercy,1
This day hasn’t had an hour that passed without me having suicidal thoughts. Cool.,1
"i have literally had a depression diagnosis since july 2015, and not once has a medical professional thought how i interact with depressing/suicidal thoughts as weird or unusual. like that part kindof flabergasts me... i have used depressive spirals/episodes as a descriptor since 2019... the fuck?",1
"Ugh, should be asleep but the depressive thoughts are intruding",1
I have this problem with overwhelming suicidal thoughts and i just want it to stop,1
Some days I wish I could disappear,1
"I wish I could just disappear and leave every feeling behind… every failure, every pain…
When I was younger I wished I could succeed in a art career… but being denied art academy at your age really struck me in the wrong way…
Now I’m a soulless being… without anything valuable in my life…",1
I don't wish BPD on anyone... 1 small thing and I absolutely wish I was dead.,1
Peak midnight suicidal rambling hours sorry,1
"Even if I get shit figured out, I'm still gonna wanna kms again in a year or so, is it really worth it to work hard if I'll just feel worse again?",1
"Marks auntie passed away late last week and it's just sinking in. Add that to the stress and worry I'm feeling at the moment and I just wanna dissappear 

Trying to snap outta this but it's not shifting.
Gonna crawl into bed, watch TV and have an early night.",1
"Woof this is a mood. I call mine “suicidal ideation man”. May not work for everyone but it helps me. If he strikes when I’m stuck in an inconvenient situation I can just “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” until the worst of it passes. 
It’s such an energy-drain to deal with these thoughts all the time.",1
Acknowledging that I'm probably gonna die a lonely POS should give me clarity or peace but it mostly just makes me wanna self-destruct quicker,1
"Like I just did a good ten half sentences, because I had to stop myself from continuing my thoughts cuz they were suicidal or self deprecating",1
dint know that stopping adderall can cause EVEN MORE depression :mmm:  no wonder i’ve been in a depressive episode,1
"TW: Suicide



The depression is bad tonight. I'm getting suicidal thoughts - the feeing that I can't do anything right, I'm wrong about everything, I can't even look after Marmite properly. It's all shit.",1
And I just feel like ending it so bad because of the way people treat me I try to be a good person but all people do is hurt me. I get attached to someone they replace me. I’m tired of this world and the people inside it. I really am. These past few days I’ve been really suicidal. And I had thoughts,1
I'm tired of being a burden... I want to be better... But I don't know how...,1
I can't keep shitposting. I have to dissociate and cry instead. My stomach hurts all the time now and I wish I was dead all the time.,1
i feel so fucking dumb posting these su!cidal posts on my alt but if i don’t get these thoughts out right now i will try my hardest to make sure i don’t see tmrw. don’t care how but i will figure it out SO i’m posting my feelings for the internet to see lmfao. hahahahaa i wanna die,1
The best part? I work for my insurance provider. I guess they’re going to have to be okay with me missing work due to pain. Feeling really defeated right now. This is not going to help with the depressive swing and suicidal thoughts I’ve been having lately.,1
"been relapsing and having suicidal thoughts and im not really sure what to do about it
been having it for a while but i guess it got to the point i think I should acknowledge it",1
