"I’m so happy it’s not Shapiro. That familiar feeling of resignation was creeping in, and democrats have endured more than enough of that. Of the obligatory Straight White Dudes I liked Beshear best for his skills talking to rural white voters (not a common skill for dems), but Walz is also great.",0
"It’s Friday. I’m exhausted and I’m still not feeling great mentally. I just want to go home, stay in tonight, wrap myself in a blanket burrito, and cuddle.",0

"On the other hand, finally paying off the credit card I maxed out to pay for my wedding is going to be a great feeling. My parents ruined my credit when I was 16 by making me a joint account holder on all sorts of maxed out cards. Tomorrow, other than student loans and a mortgage, I'm debt free.",0
Post @thoughtbubbleuk.bsky.social haul post.  I wasn't feeling too well and was hauling around my portfolio so didn't see as much as I wanted but picked up a few things and met a few new people.  Nice sketch from Ruari Coleman who I loved chatting to and great print from Steve White,0
Got a feeling she’ll be great at solving murder cases and such 👀🔎,0

I have a few little things planned this week, and hope I see you guys on Friday for my live music cover recording so you can be in my video!",0
"First watch (courtesy of the local library): Meek's Cutoff 2010). Revisionist western-cum-survival movie with strong allegorical overtones. The premise is great, but I couldn't help feeling it didn't quite deliver the slow burn paranoia of Kelly Reichardt's Night Moves. 1/",0
"Space Mutiny and Final Sacrifice are my go to’s whenever I’m feeling low

Money Talks is my favorite short
Robot Rumpus is also another great one",0
That's a great way to describe Ringworld. I remember reaching the conclusion of that book and feeling like I'd had the rug pulled out from under me.,0
This is that feeling before great shit starts to happen 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾,0

"Oh excellent! Great ink choice too. 

the m800 is an awesome pen. big but not too big, nice weight to it. the nibs are pretty similar to the 400/600 despite being 18k. the m1000 has a much different feeling nib than everything else from pelikan... but it's prohibitively expensive, which is a shame",0
"It's a really good TCG that has an easy entry point but a very high skill ceiling so I'd recommend it for sure

If you're a fan of OP it's even better too, the art on the cards is great, and the quality of the cards themselves feels so good; best feeling cards out there to me",0
"Feeling pretty cruddy today already and then I tuned into a DJ on twitch, who started talking about how much she loved JKR and how great her books were.  I told her, ""Hey, it turns out that she's a huge transphobe and a lot of trans folks feel betrayed by her.""  So I got banned from her chat.",0
Not feeling great about any of the names mentioned except for maybe Wikler who is one of those insufferable midwesterners who confuses where they live with accomplishing something but he is obsessed with winning and doesn't seem keen on throwing trans people under the bus to do it.,0
"It’s a great feeling, isn’t it? That exactly why I went earlier while people were doing pregame.",0
"Great article.  I agree, Levis isn’t the guy, and if the new GM isn’t feeling it with these top QBs, I hope he doesn’t get FOMO, I’d like the case to trade down and get Carter, he could be a game changer on defense.  The Titans could bridge with Darnold.",0
"I know I didn't really post too much today but I'm going to bed because I have to be up early for work. At least I found out that I'll have next Monday off too so that'll be nice :)

Good night Bluesky, we have another great weekend on the horizon I'm feeling! ❤️",0
"Great idea, let's encircle him with THAAD and Patriots. I have a feeling that Putin has no Oreshniks to spare and couldn't build them in the foreseeable future. Lukashenko is talking from his arse.",0
"I hope so. There are some dark times ahead for us. Someone has to be a beacon of hope & reason. When I start feeling down. I have a few songs I play to cheer myself. This is an old one, I hadn't realized how positive these lyrics are. 😁🤗 Have a great day!  youtu.be/Ss8_X2VvHZs?...",0
"driving through Boalsburg, PA seeing a digital billboard ad that said “we’re ready mr president, make us great again” is so sadly dystopian and this despondent feeling hasn’t left me since.",0

Great to see you again, Sumire.",0

"Definitely.  I've been feeling better than I expected.

I had switched from carnivore to animal-based during my pregnancy because I was feeling sick and fatigued with a lower carb diet.

I didn't think that I could switch back during breastfeeding, but I tried it and feel great.",0

Take a deep breath
Look away from your screen
Observe your environment and list a few things in it
Notice the feeling of your hands
Any fabric or surface you can touch
Really feel it
And breathe
Recentre
Take your time
Let whatever come next come when ready
You're doing great.",0
"i have nothing but visceral hate for him

this game is great for evoking that kind of feeling. death is too good for the guy",0
It's such a great feeling seeing something you envisioned working the way you envisioned it working! An hour and 20 minutes on the treadmill while working. My detached garages' internet strength is the same as what my bedroom had before implementing mesh.,0
"Forget Great… I’m just feeling embarrassed again. 😞

It's amazing how effective it is to just start out saying you agree and OP made great points before building off of it. A single sentence can head off so much misunderstanding or feeling talked over. No one knows what's going on in your head if you don't say it.,0
"It's a scary feeling. But the fact that you're passionate about it, the efforts you want to put toward a group of people are honorable. The fact that you have these fears, I think already proves you have a lot of care for this team and will do great. Good luck with everything. 🩷",0
Learning how to play a song is such a good feeling! I think just about everybody can benefit from picking up an instrument and learning some songs. You dont even have to play that well to have a great time,0

It makes for a great** combination with post-viral fatigue syndrome making almost any activity feel tiring.

**terrible",0
I was feeling good about the character I was taking into Elden Ring dlc and then I died like five times on one of the first enemies. Great game,0

I know the feeling :( but I personally think it is :) you have a great voice,0
"Thanks, Barbara. I really do appreciate it. Everyone here is great, and I’m feeling ok. Like I mentioned to another person, this is just another bump in the road to which I will make it through. It could be worse.",0
"Gameplay is nice, the story compelling and they got the actors for voiceover which is a real treat. And Drummer is just great.
Yot get a good feeling for Belter Scavengers and you steer completely free in the space and be switching to mag boots.",0
"You did a fanfuckingtastic job, hun!

Morning/afternoon everyone! I hope you all have a great day 🙂,0
"it's not something i do 100% of the time every day, but it's really helpful when i find myself getting in a slump or a spiral, just because it puts such a squash on that ""i'm useless, i did nothing today"" feeling. it's also great for answering ""why the fuck do i feel so drained?""",0
It's changed my life too!! It definitely helps with anxiety and it is a great positive channel for obsessive tendencies I sometimes have! I love the feeling of absorption and flow it brings. I don't know where I'd be without it!,0
"I woke up today not feeling great. After a hot shower, I feel better. I think it was just one of those headaches I get when a front passes through. No fever, sore throat, or anything else",0

I hope it stays a great feeling everytime you write a new story.,0
